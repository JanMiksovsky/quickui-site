<title>Control events</title>

<p>
This page describes some events raised by the QuickUI runtime or commonly
used in QuickUI controls.
</p>

<h2><a id="layout">layout</a></h2>
<p>
Controls can bind to the layout event if they want to perform custom layout.
This event will be triggered whenever a change in window size results in a
change in the control's size. If the control's layout may need to update when
a child changes size, the control should also bind to the sizeChanged event.
</p>
<p>
When binding a handler to this event, an initial invocation of the handler will
be made. The initial invocation will happen immediately if the control is
already in the DOM; otherwise, the initial invocation will happen once the
control is added to the DOM.
</p>
<p>
The event will not be triggered for any control not in the DOM.
</p>

<h2><a id="sizeChanged">sizeChanged</a></h2>
<p>
A control can raise this event if it wants to cooperatively notify its
containers that its size has changed. Rather than triggering this directly, it's
best to call a control's
<a data-control="Link" href="control-prototype-methods.html#checkForSizeChange">checkForSizeChange()</a>
method. That method will only
trigger the event if the control's size has, in fact, changed since it was
last checked. 
</p>
<p>
This event is not used by the QuickUI framework runtime, but is commonly used
by QuickUI controls.
