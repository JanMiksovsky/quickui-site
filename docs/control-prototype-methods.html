<title>Control instance methods</title>

</head>

<body data-create-controls="true" data-control="DocumentationPage">

<p>
These functions are available on all control <i>instances</i>.
Since Control is is a subclass of jQuery, all jQuery
members are available on Control as well.
</p>
<p>
These methods all follow jQuery plugin conventions. They are all chainable,
and if desired they can be applied to an array of multiple controls at once.
</p>

<h2>applyClass( classes [, value] )</h2>
<p>
Gets or sets whether the given CSS class(es) are applied to the controls. This
combines the functions of $.hasClass (when called as a getter) and $.toggleClass
(when called as a setter). This applyClass() function is useful in the context
of a chain() binding, allowing the control to expose a boolean getter/setter
the governs the application of a given CSS class.
</p>

<pre>
&lt;Control name="MyControl"&gt;

&lt;content&gt;
    ...
&lt;/content&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
.disabled {
    color: gray;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
MyControl.prototype.extend({
    // Expose a boolean disabled() property that causes the "disabled"
    // CSS class to be applied or removed.
    disabled: Control.chain("applyClass/disabled")
});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/Control&gt;
</pre>

<h2>cast()</h2>
<p>
Given a jQuery array of elements of potentially differing control classes,
this returns the array cast to the most specific class which all the elements
have in common. This is typically done prior to invoking a function, to ensure
that the same implementation of the function is invoked on all the elements. 
</p>

<h2><a id="checkForSizeChange">checkForSizeChange()</a></h2>
<p>
This method checks to see if the control's size has changed since it was last
checked. (The check always succeeds the first time this is called.) If the
control's size has in fact changed, the control raises the
<a data-control="Link" href="control-events.html#sizeChanged">sizeChanged</a>
event.
</p>

<h2>content( [value] )</h2>
<p>
Gets or sets the content of the elements. This is a helper function that performs
two main tasks.
</p>
<p>
First, it provides a single entry point to manipulate the content
of a regular HTML element (via $.html) or an input element like a text box (via $.val).
This makes it easier to change control elements from standard HTML input elements to
QuickUI controls in their own right (or change them back) without having to rewrite
much code.
</p>
<p>
Second, this function normalizes the content to a canonical form. For example, if the
content of an element is set to a string value, then when it is read back, it will
be returned as a single string. (In comparison, reading text nodes via $.content
will return an array.)  
</p>
<p>
The JavaScript generated for a control's markup makes use of the content() function
to render a control. In particular, if a QuickUI control tag contains HTML
or subcontrols, those elements will be passed into the content() function to render
the control. Control classes often override content() to identify where their primary
content should go.
</p>

<h2>controlClass()</h2>
<p>
Returns the actual control class of the first element in the array. (Cf. cast(),
which looks for the common class of all elements in the array, and returns the
array as an instance of that common class.) Note that the actual control class
of an element may differ from the class of the Control (jQuery) subclass used
to access it:
</p>

<pre>
var $e = Control "&lt;button>"  // $e is an instanceof Control
$e.control( BasicButton )       // Turns the element into a BasicButton 
$e.className()                  // Returns "Control"
$e.controlClass()               // Returns the BasicButton class
</pre>

<h2>eachControl( fn )</h2>
<p>
This is similar to $.each(), and loops over the array of elements in a jQuery object,
invoking a callback function for each element. Unlike $.each(), the callback function
is supplied with the current element cast to the control's specific class (if the element
is a control) or null (if the element is not a control). The array can contain controls
of differing classes, in which case any methods applied to the control could end up
invoking different implementations according to each control's class.
</p>

<pre>
// Loop over all BasicButtons on the page (including subclasses of BasicButton).
var $buttons = Control( ".BasicButton" );
$buttons.eachControl( function( index, $button ) {
    // Invoke each button's content() setter, which may vary by button class.
    $button.content("Hello");
});
</pre>

<h2>inDocument( callback )</h2>
<p>
If the control is already in the current document (web page), the callback is
executed immediately. Otherwise, the callback will be queued up for execution
if and when the control is later added to the document. This can be useful
in situations where the control depends on knowing its own styling, as CSS is
only applied to controls in the document. The inDocument() callback is typically
requested inside an initialize() handler.
</p>
<p>
Inside callback, "this" refers to the control which has (just) been added to
the document.
</p>

<pre>
initialize: function() {
    this.inDocument( function() {
        // Make the control as tall as it is wide.
        this.height( this.width() + "px" );
    });
}
</pre>

<h2><a id="initialize">initialize()</a></h2>
<p>
This initialize() method is invoked when a new control is instantiated, and is typically
used for wiring up event handlers, perform any initial calculations, etc.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The initialize() call is made immediately after the control is instantiated
        and <i>after</i> initial property values have been set by the control's host,
        e.g., in the properties parameter supplied to create().
    </li>
    <li>
        The initialize() function is an implied iterator. If an array of controls is
        being instantiated at once, each will have its initialize() method called
        separately, with "this" inside each call corresponding to the given control.
    </li>
    <li>
        The initialize() methods of base classes are invoked before the
        initialize() method of a subclass.
    </li>
    <li>
        The initialize() method of any (inner) child conrols is invoked <i>before</i> the
        initialize() method is invoked on the (outer) parent control.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the control was created from scratch (i.e., not by wrapping an element
        already in the DOM), the initialize() call will happen before the control
        is in the DOM. Among other things, the control will not yet have a defined
        height and width. If it's necessary for the control to perform work once
        its in the DOM, it can either rely on a higher-level parent to tell it
        when this has happened, or it can listen for an event like DOMNodeInserted.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>json( json )</h2>
<p>
Sets properties on the control using
<a data-control="Link" href="control-JSON.html">Control JSON</a>.
This is similar to the properties()
function, in that both take a property dictionary and apply it to a control,
but json() evaluates the values in that dictionary, whereas properties() uses the
values exactly as is.
</p>

<h2>properties( properties )</h2>
<p>
Sets the given properties on the control(s).
</p>
<pre>
var userTile = UserTile.create();
userTile.properties({
    name: "Rachel Garcia",
    picture: "picture1.png"
});
</pre>

<p>
The keys of the supplied property dictionary are invoked as setters. The
above code is equivalent to:
</p>
<pre>
var userTile = UserTile.create()
    .name( "Rachel Garcia" )
    .picture( "picture1.png" );
</pre>

<p>
Note that the $.control() plugin also allows the creation of a new control and
the setting of properties in a single step, so the above could also be written:
</p>
<pre>
var userTile = $("&lt;div/&gt;").control(UserTile, {
    name: "Rachel Garcia",
    picture: "picture1.png"
});
</pre>

<h2>propertyVector( propertyName, values )</h2>
<p>
Gets or sets the given property on multiple elements at once. If called
as a getter, an array of the property's current values is returned.
If called as a setter, that property of each element will be set to
the corresponding defined member of the values array. (Array values
which are undefined will not be set.)
</p>

<pre>
// Set the content property of the first three Foo instances on the page
// to the strings "One", "Two", and "Three", respectively.
$(".Foo")           // Find all Foo instances
    .control()      // Cast the result to class Foo
    .multiProperty("content", [ "One", "Two", "Three" ]);
</pre>

<h2>segments()</h2>
<p>
This returns an array, each member of which is a
individual control object holding the corresponding element. (That is, it returns
an array of arrays.) This result can then be easily iterated over in a for loop,
without having to create a callback function, as is the case with eachControl().
</p>

<pre>
var buttons = $( ".BasicButton" ).control().segments();
for ( var i = 0; i &lt; buttons.length; i++ ) {
    buttons[i].hide();  // Or any other jQuery or Control manipulation.
}
</pre>

<p>
In CoffeeScript, the result of segments() can be directly iterated over in
a for loop:
</p>

<pre>
# CoffeeScript "for" loop iterating over segments.
for button in $( ".BasicButton" ).control().segments()
  button.hide()
</pre>

<h2>_super( [arguments] )</h2>
<p>
Within a control method, this invokes the method of the same name on the
control's superclass. This is useful when extending (as opposed to completely
overriding) a superclass' behavior
</p>

<h2>transmute( newClass, preserveContent, preserveClasses )</h2>
<p>
Converts the control(s) to the indicated class. If preserveContent is true (the default
is false), the existing contents of the control will be extracted and then set again
on the control via the new class' content() property.
</p>
<p>
If preserveClasses is true (the default is false), then the existing classes on the
old control will be preserved on the element's "class" attribute. This can be useful to
leave a trace of the transmutation for debugging purposes.
</p>

<h2>visibility( [value] )</h2>
<p>
Gets or sets whether the given control(s) are visible. This combines the functions
of $.is(":visible") when called as a getter, and $.toggle() when called as a setter.
</p>
