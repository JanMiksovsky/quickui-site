<title>QuickUI control class guidelines</title>

</head>

<body data-create-controls="true" data-control="DocumentationPage">

<p>
To maximize the ability of other designers and developers to understand, debug,
and reuse your code, consider the following guidelines.
</p>

<h2>Modularity</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Each control should have a clear task or responsibility that can be succinctly
        stated. State this purpose in a comment at the top of the control's source file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Design controls to be as context-independent as possible. The control should
        make as few assumptions as possible about its container's class, styles, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        As an analogue of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a>,
        a control should directly manipulate only the elements which it, itself,
        has added to the DOM in the class’ <Tag>content</Tag> or <Tag>prototype</Tag>,
        or in its own member functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a corollary to the above point, a control should expose information to
        outside consumers via property setters and other methods, rather than expecting
        them to directly grovel the control’s own DOM.
    </li>
    <li>
        The script tag for a control should generally define the control class’ prototype
        and (if applicable) class-level methods. Avoid other side-effects.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Subclassing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Derive from standard base classes in the QuickUI Catalog when appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a control overrides a superclass method, the method
        should generally invoke the same method in the superclass’ prototype. This is
        particularly important with definining an initialize() handler for any class
        that doesn't inherit directly from Control. The base Control.initialize()
        implementation doesn't do anything, and therefore does not have to be invoked.
    </li>
    <li>
        A control may call “private” methods (indicated with an “_” underscore) in its
        parent classes. That is, such methods are treated as if they were “protected”.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the jQuery extend() method on the control's prototype to define control
        instance behavior. If applicable, also use extend() on the control class itself
        to define class-level behavior, such as enums shared by all instances of a class.

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
MyControl.prototype.extend({
    // Instance methods
    foo: function() { ... },
    bar: function() { ... },
    ...
});

MyControl.extend({
    // Class methods
    ...
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Avoid requiring that a control must have properties set on it, and provide
        useful default values for all properties. It should be possible to
        instantiate a control class with a standalone tag. E.g., a control class called
        Foo should be instantiable with an unadorned call to Foo.create(). If possible,
        the resulting control should ideally provide some minimal functionality or
        behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a general rule, values which are set on a control via a setter should be
        retrievable by calling the same function as a getter. Avoid write-only functions
        that permanently change control state without affording access to that state.
    </li>
    <li>
        It should be possible to set properties in any order. If a control has two
        properties that work in tandem, have the side-effect function for each invoke
        a “private” function that checks to see if both are set before doing its work.
    </li>
    <li>
        If someone will be likely to want to set a property through markup, support the ability to set a property as a string. Use the specific property constructors like Control.property.bool().
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to set complex defaults in initialize(), remember that the initialize() call happens after per-instance properties have been set. The initialize handler should generally only set a property to its default value if the property hasn’t already been set.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding style and naming conventions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Follow the 
        <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines">jQuery Core Style Guidelines</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The typical order of tags within a Control class is: <Tag>content</Tag> or
        <Tag>prototype</Tag>, <Tag>style</Tag>, and finally <Tag>script</Tag>.
        This recognizes the fact that the content or prototype is generally the most
        helpful way to orient someone to the control's construction.

<pre>
&lt;Control name="Greet"&gt;

&lt;content&gt;
    Hello, &lt;span id="name"/&gt;!
&lt;/content&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#name {
    font-weight: bold;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
Greet.prototype.extend({
    ...
});
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/Control&gt;
</pre>

    </li>
    <li>
        For very simple controls which define no style or script, the
        <Tag>content</Tag> tag can optionally be dropped.
    </li>
    <li>
        Classes and properties should have meaningful names in PascalCase (for classes)
        and camelCase (for properties).
    </li>
    <li>
        Class names are generally nouns rather than verbs, and often reflect the
        level of the UI at which they operate. E.g.: OrderEnterPage instead of
        EnterOrder, AmountTextBox instead of TypeInAmount.
    </li>
    <li>
        To indicate quasi-private methods which control consumers should <i>not</i> call
        directly, prefix their name with an underscore "_".
    </li>
    <li>
        Generally speaking, try to avoid abbreviations or contractions in identifier names.
        E.g., a dialog class should be called SignUpDialog instead of SgnUpDlg.
        Widely accepted acronyms are fine, but for acronyms three or more letters in
        length, use lowercase for characters after the first position.
        E.g.: EnterUrlDialog instead EnterURLDialog.
    </li>
    <li>
        In closures, the variable to capture “this” is generally called “self”.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Styling</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        General-purpose base classes should avoid imposing an arbitrary visual style
        on all subclasses. Base classes can define styles that are likely to be
        desired by all subclasses, but stylistic decisions should as color, font, etc.
        should usually be left up to subclasses.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Base classes can provide a bare-bones UI (so that, e.g., control elements
        are visible and legible) by application of a generic CSS class. This
        class will automatically be applied if the class prototype's
        genericSupport member is true.
    </li>
    <li>
        When necessary, a control subclass can define style rules that adjust the appearance of
        elements added by its parent classes. I.e., those elements are treated as
        protected members of the class.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not advisable to directly style the subelements of contained controls.
        If necessary, create a subclass of the control in question, then override the
        parent class style in that (per the above point). This at least makes apparent
        the fact that the normal parent class styling is being overruled.
    </li>
</ul>
