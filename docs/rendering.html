<p>
QuickUI has a simple and elegant system with which a control can render itself
into the DOM: a new control invokes property setters on its base classes, each
of which can partially fill in the DOM, until the final control is completely
populated with elements. This page walks through how that system works, and why
it allows for a great deal of flexibility and extensibility.
</p>

<p>
At a motivating example, consider the task of creating page template for a
simple online store selling a variety of products. This store may have
a collection of page templates — some general, some specific — for presenting
information about the company and its products. Let's examine how these
templates and pages could be implemented as controls.
</p>

<h2>Starting with a base class</h2>

<p>
In the case of creating a page template as a control, we could start by
subclassing the base Control class, but there's a more specific subclass called
<a data-control="CatalogLink">Page</a> that offers a few helpful properties
like fill() and title(). We can create a trivial derivation of the Page class
like this:
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/TrivialPage.js"></div>

<p>
When we create an instance of this trivial page class, we end up with a page
whose default content is entirely empty. Accordingly, this page has nothing to
render when its created:
</p>

<div data-control="Page">
    <div class="placeholder" style="height: 100%;">(Content)</div>
</div>

<p>
We can programmatically add content at run-time by setting this page's content()
property, but let's enhance our page control so that it knows how to render its
own content.
</p>

<h2>Setting content via a property on a base class</h2>

<p>
Control classes can perform work when they are instantiated, and the most common
work they do is to invoke property setters on their base classes. Let's create
a simple page class that sets its own content() property, which it inherits
from a base class:
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/SimplePage.js"></div>

<p>
The above definition stashes a simple JavaScript object (i.e., a dictionary)
in a member called "inherited" on the SimplePage class' prototype.
Whenever SimplePage is instantiated, e.g., by a call to
SimplePage.create(), the values in this "inherited" member will be invoked as
property setters. Here, the indicated text string will be passed to the
control's content() property.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the closest ancestor class of SimplePage that defines a
content() property is Control. The base Control implementation of content() has
generally the same effect of setting the innerHTML of control's top element
via jQuery
<a data-control="Link" href="http://api.jquery.com/html/">$.html()</a>
function.
Page.content(). So a new instance of SimplePage will end up looking like:  
</p>

<div data-control="SimplePage"></div>

<p>
At this stage, we're simply populating the DOM in a declarative fashion; we
could have acheived the same results by invoking $.html() with the given text.
But by defining the user interface of a page class this way, we open the door
to easy extensibility.
</p>

<h2>Creating a site-wide page template</h2>
<p>
Let's use this same approach to create a simple page template that includes a
heading area and a content area. This time, the default content will set
via "inherited" will include two HTML elements: an
<span data-control="Tag">h1</span> to hold the heading, and a
<span data-control="Tag">div</span> to hold the main content. 
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/SiteTemplate.js"></div>


<p>
The last two signficiant lines define two properties called content() and
heading(). These use the
<a data-control="Link" href="control-class-methods.html#chain">Control.chain()</a>
helper function. This effectively delegates any values passed to or from
SiteTemplate's heading() or content() property to the
<span data-control="Tag">h1</span> or <span data-control="Tag">div</span>,
respectively.
</p>

<p>
The result is a page that now has two "slots" that can be filled in:
</p>

<div data-control="SiteTemplate">
    <div data-property="heading">
        <div class="placeholder">(Heading)</div>
    </div>
    <div class="placeholder" style="height: 170px;">(Content)</div>
</div>

<p>
Note that SiteTemplate <i>overrides</i> the base Control.content() property.
Any value passed to SiteTemplate's content() setter will go into the
<span data-control="Tag">div</span>. Effectively SiteTemplate has partially
filled itself in: it renders two elements itself, therbey enforcing a certain
page structure, then leaves the other details to outside hosts or subclasses
of SiteTemplate. This rendering technique is very common in QuickUI controls,
and is similar in concept to abstract classes in various programming languages. 
</p>

<h2>Using a template in vanilla HTML for good searchability</h2>

<p>
Now that we've defined a SiteTemplate, we can create an instance of that
template in a variety of ways. One simple way is to use vanilla HTML:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;body data-create-controls="true" data-control="SiteTemplate">
    &lt;div data-property="heading">Home Page&lt;/div>
    Welcome to our web site.
&lt;/body>
</pre>

<p>
All this text will be indexable, and therefore searchable. When a user views
the page, an instance of SiteTemplate is created, and the indicated heading
and content are passed to the heading() and content() properties. In this way,
the page is completely rendered:</p>

<div data-control="HomePage"></div>

<h2>Creating a page by subclassing the template</h2>
<p>
We could also create the exact same page above as a subclass of SiteTemplate:
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/HomePage.js"></div>

<p>
This method makes the page text opaque to search engines, but maybe useful in
applications — or portions thereof — where searchability is not important.
</p>

<h2>Creating a more specific template for a specific site area</h2>

<p>
Our new SiteTemplate control class, which we created by subclassing Page,
is itself extensible. We can use this feature to create a more specific
template for the Products area of our hypothetical online store. Just as we
defined SiteTemplate to partially fill in a Page, we can define a
ProductTemplate class to partially fill in a SiteTemplate:
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/ProductTemplate.js"></div>

<p>
We once again define a content() property that overrides the base (SiteTemplate)
implementation. We define a heading() property that overrides the
base implementation as well. The resulting ProductTemplate renders like so:
</p>

<div data-create-controls="true" data-control="ProductTemplate">
    <div data-property="heading">
        <span class="placeholder">(Heading)</span>
    </div>
    <div class="placeholder" style="height: 180px; margin-right: 80px;">(Content)</div>
</div>

<h2>Using the template for a product page</h2>

<p>
Using the above template, we can create a page in our Products area via HTML…
</p>

<pre>
&lt;body data-control="ProductTemplate">
    &lt;div data-property="Heading">Widget&lt;div>
    This is a general-purpose widget to satisfy any need.
&lt;/body>
</pre>

<p>
… or in JavaScript:
</p>

<div data-control="SourceFileContents" data-path="samples/SampleProductPage.js"></div>

<p>
The result in either case will be a completely rendered product page:
</p>

<div data-control="SampleProductPage"></div>

<p>
The sample templates and pages are deliberately simplistic, but the same
concepts can be used to acheive a user interface of arbitrary complexity.
</p>

<h2>The benefits of modularity and extensibility</h2>
<p>
There are a number of advantages to creating our application this way:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We can define elements (and behavior) shared across pages in a single
        place. The <span data-control="Tag">h1</span> used by SiteTemplate is
        defined only once, so we if we want to replace that with a different
        element, or another QuickUI control, we only need to make the change
        in one place to see its effects in all pages using the template.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each class has a very limited set of responsibilities, and so we can
        focus each class on doing its job very well. If we identify a usability
        improvement in the general product template (a new location for the
        Buy Now button, say), it's very easy to identify where that work needs
        to take place.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every page in our site is inherently extensible. Some templating systems
        assume a single level of template-ness; the result of a template is
        static HTML that can't be further extended. With QuickUI,
        we can create a class hierarchy that's as deep as we need. All of
        our classes — Page, SiteTemplate, or ProductTemplate — are automatically
        subclassable, even classes like SampleProductPage (above),
        which initially we might assume will only have one instance.
        If we later identify a situation where we want to create a subclass of
        that page, we don't have to go back and make that class extensible; it's
        already extensible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Every element of our user interface has the same properties. We can use
        the exact same model to create custom buttons, lists, menus, and so on.
        We don't have to learn one set of techniques for pages, and a different
        set for rows in a table, another for widgets, and so on. All user
        interface elements, from the outermost page to the tiniest UI flourish,
        can be modeled the same way.
    </li>
</ul>
