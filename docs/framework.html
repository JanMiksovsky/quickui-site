<title>QuickUI Framework Overview</title>

</head>

<body data-create-controls="true" data-control="DocumentationPage">

<p>
<i>
This overview is intended for an audience with a basic understanding of
JavaScript programming and the jQuery framework. This is currently a draft;
the final version will be expanded with sample code. 
</i>
</p>

<p>
This page summarizes the control facilities delivered by the QuickUI framework
in the form of a JavaScript runtime called quickui.js. Both this runtime and the
core jQuery must be included in a web page to use QuickUI.
</p>

<h2>Control class creation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
QuickUI builds on the prototype-based class system offered in jQuery via its
$.sub() function. What this means is that controls in the QuickUI framework are
instances of full JavaScript classes. For example, controls have a type which
can be checked directly using JavaScript’s instanceof keyword.    
</li>
<li>
Control instances are full jQuery objects. Any operation that can be performed
on a jQuery object — showing or hiding the control, changing stylistic
attributes such as color, animated transitions, programmatically adding or
removing the control, etc. — can all be performed on a control.
</li>
<li>
In addition to the jQuery features, custom features can be easily added to
control classes as class methods. These methods are, in fact, jQuery plugins
(extensions). This means methods can be easily applied using the full power of
jQuery’s selection engine. In jQuery style, control methods are also chainable,
and can be applied to arrays of objects in a single call.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI’s use of JavaScript classes provides a built-in scoping mechanism for
class methods. In raw jQuery plugin creation, a common concern is the crowding
of the jQuery plugin namespace. This forces developers to take measures such as
squeezing all features of a new jQuery extension into a single overloaded
function, which can compromise clarity and maintainability. In QuickUI,
namespace pollution is less of an issue because each control receives its own
plugin namespace.
</li>
<li>
Using a class system means that control instances automatically have access to
JavaScript methods defined by their class or parent classes. Well-designed class
hierarchies can thereby achieve a proper separation of concerns, which
facilitates code creation and maintenance.
</li>
<li>
In general, QuickUI controls follow a single inheritance model. This is rarely a
limitation: for most non-trivial controls, a chunk of one UI is either one kind
of component or another. It is possible to fold JavaScript-style mixins into a
control’s definition. For example, jQuery UI’s lower-level facilities for mouse
interaction or drag-and-drop can be easily added to a QuickUI control.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI control classes have access to a _super() function that makes it simple
for a class method to extend the behavior defined in a base class.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instantiation, rendering, initialization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Controls can be instantiated from a set of DOM elements via a top-level
jQuery plugin called $.control(). The basic form of this renders all DOM
elements selected by the jQuery object into instances of the corresponding
control class.
</li>
<li>
Controls can also be instantiated from a class by calling the class’
.create() method. This renders a detached instance of that class which can
later be added to the DOM.
</li>
<li>
Rendering a DOM element into a control generally entails populating the
element with a new collection of subelements and applying CSS classes associated
with the control class.
</li>
<li>
A core aspect of QuickUI is that it defines a render sequence that
corresponds to a control’s class hierarchy. When an element is rendered into a
control, each class in the control’s class hierarchy has an opportunity to add
subelements to the top-level element. This is done by starting from a base class
called Control (which inherits directly from jQuery), and working down the class
hierarchy to the control’s specific class. This arrangement means that each
level of the class hierarchy can add elements into positions that depend upon
the DOM structure created by their parent classes.
</li>
<li>
After a control instance has been rendered, QuickUI automatically invokes
an initialization function on the instance called initialize(). This gives the
each level of the control’s class hierarchy the chance to perform additional
work beyond simply rendering the control.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Element classification</h2>
<ul>
<li>
When a control class is rendered into a DOM element, the QuickUI framework
preserves an association between that element and that class.
</li>
<li>
This effectively means that a given DOM element can “have” a custom class.
The DOM element is still really an instance of a DOM class like HTMLDivElement.
A DOM class is notoriously problematic to actually subclass, but the QuickUI
association between an element and a control class provides a way to get most of
the benefits of subclassing a DOM class without any of the many problems that
come with that.
</li>
<li>
The control class for an element can be quickly retrieved by finding that
element with a normal jQuery selector, then invoking the $.control() plugin on
that jQuery object. This casts the jQuery object to an object of the appropriate
class. The object will still be a jQuery object (because all control classes
inherit from the jQuery base class), but it will also be an instance of the
relevant control class and its control parent classes. This is what affords
access to the control class’ namespace of custom jQuery methods (plugins).
</li>
<li>
The class of a DOM element can be changed dynamically at run-time by
“transmuting” a control instance into an instance of a different class.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Styling controls with CSS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
QuickUI provides for an automatic association between JavaScript control classes
and an identically-named set of CSS classes. Every control class Foo implies a
corresponding CSS class called “.Foo”.
</li>
<li>
When a control class is rendered into a DOM element, the QuickUI framework
automatically stamps that element’s “class” attribute with the CSS classes that
correspond to the control class and its parent classes. These CSS classes are
applied in order from most specific to most general class. E.g., if a control
MyButton derives from Control, the creating an instance of MyButton will produce
a DOM element that has class=”.MyButton .Control”.
</li>
<li>
Control designers can capitalize on this aspect of QuickUI using a convention
for writing style rules. A style rule of the form “.MyButton { color: red }”
will have the effect that all text within a MyButton control will be red.
</li>
<li>
This arrangement allows the creation of CSS styles that correspond clearly and
directly to a control class. The browser will then ensure that instances of a
given control class end up receiving all of that control class’ style rules.
</li>
<li>
Because these CSS classes are applied to a control’s top-level element in order
from most specific to most general class, subclasses can override the CSS style
rules defined by base classes.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>
A general guideline for controls is that they make their properties available as
jQuery-style getter/setter functions. This means that, if a value is passed to
the property function, it sets the property; if no value is passed in, the
function returns the current value of that property.
</li>
<li>
To facilitate the creation of getter/setter property functions, QuickUI provides
a set of helper functions. The base Control.property() function creates a
getter/setter that automatically handles per-control storage of the property
value via jQuery $.data(). A side-effect function can also be defined that will
be executed whenever the property is set, so the control can do custom work if
the property changes.
</li>
<li>
A number of related Control.property helper functions are designed to simplify
the setting of properties via strings. This is done to support the use of
controls in QuickUI markup.
</li>
<li>
All property getter/setters created via Control.property automatically work
against arrays of controls, and are chainable.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chaining properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>
It’s important for controls to hide their implementation to some degree, so that
troublesome dependencies are not created upon the control’s current
implementation and thereby impede future improvements. This is especially
important when it comes to the control’s DOM – a control’s host shouldn’t need
to know anything about the DOM below the control’s top-level element.
</li>
<li>
Rather than expecting hosts to directly read or manipulate a control’s DOM,
QuickUI controls expose programmatic interfaces, notably with getter/setter
properties, that form an abstraction around the DOM. That is, controls expose
an external API of getter/setter property functions that can manipulate a
control’s internal DOM.
</li>
<li>
It is very common for these getter/setter properties to execute a single chain
of jQuery methods that locate a specific DOM element within the control and then
manipulate some aspect of that element such as its content or styling.
</li>
<li>
To facilitate the creation of such jQuery chains, QuickUI provides a helper
function called Control.chain. This constructs a getter/setter property that
generally manipulates some aspect of the control’s internal DOM. The resulting
property is automatically applicable to arrays of controls, and is automatically
chainable.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The QuickUI framework recognizes that, in most cases, a given user interface
control will have portion of it that represents the control’s primary “content”.
In simple cases, such as a button, the button’s content is its label. In more
complex cases, such as a tab in a set of tabs, the tab’s content is the
collection of elements shown when the tab is selected (as opposed to the tab’s
label, which appears in the set of tab buttons).
</li> 
<li>
QuickUI defines a general notion of element content via a getter/setter property
called content(). The base implementation of this property handles standard HTML
elements. The content of an input control is defined as its value via $.val().
The content of any other standard element is the array of child nodes. (For
comparison, jQuery provides a $.contents() function – with a final “s” – that
returns child nodes, but QuickUI’s content() function is writeable, whereas
jQuery’s $.contents() is read-only.
</li>
<li>
The QuickUI content() property attempts to normalize content values. For
example, if the content of a div element is a single text node, the text node
is returned as a simple string, rather than an array containing a single text
node. This simplifies the transfer of values out of the DOM, e.g., for the
purpose of sending data to the server.
</li>
<li>
Control classes can override the base content() property to redefine what they
consider to be their “content”.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Subclasses can fill in “slots” in DOM elements created by their superclasses</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The combination of subclass-ability and getter/setter property functions which
manipulate the contents of a control’s internal DOM elements, leads to a
powerful model in which base classes can define multiple “slots” in their UI.
</li>
<li>
These “slots” can be filled in by subclasses. That is, a base control can fill
out part of its UI and leave multiple slots which can be filled in by
subclasses. The subclasses can fill in these slots with their own UI elements.
</li>
<li>
Subclasses in turn can leaves slots to be filled in by more specific subclasses.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Element reference functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Once a control populates its DOM with various elements, it can be problematic
later on to reacquire references to those elements. For example, per the above
discussion of “slots”, a control’s content may be partially filled out by
subclasses. These subclasses may add elements within the control’s DOM with
conflicting IDs or CSS classes.
</li>
<li>
To ensure a control can work with the elements it, itself, has added to the DOM,
QuickUI provides support for element reference functions. These functions
capture a reference to an element at the moment the element is first created.
The reference can later be retrieved to obtain the original element, without
concern that a similar element may have since been introduced to the DOM.
</li>
<li>
Element reference functions are jQuery plugins that can be applied to a jQuery
array and are chainable. In essence, an element reference function is a mapping
function that maps a jQuery array of controls to an array of corresponding
elements within those controls.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Generic styling</h2>
<ul>
<li>
QuickUI encourages control authors to provide as little aesthetic styling as
possible, simplifying the adaptation of a control to a product’s particular
visual aesthetic.
</li>
<li>
At the same time, it’s useful for a control author to define some very basic
styling for the control so that it can be used without requiring any styling.
</li>
<li>
For this purpose, QuickUI defines a notion of a “generic” style. A control shows
its generic style by default.
</li>
<li>
A control host can explicit turn off the generic style.
</li>
<li>
If a control is subclassed, the generic style is automatically surpressed.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
QuickUI controls can be created dynamically in JavaScript. Such controls are
said to be in a “live” state in which they can be programmatically manipulated.
</li>
<li>
It’s disadvantageous for sites to completely define pages via JavaScript code;
much of the site’s content may not be crawlable by a web search engine, leading
to poor performance in web searches.
</li>
<li>
Accordingly, QuickUI controls can also be created in a “dehydrated” state via
static HTML. Standard “data-” properties are added to the static HTML to
indicate which content should be “rehydrated” on the client as controls. The
existence of the static content gives the resulting web page good SEO (Search
Engine Optimization) characteristics. Once the controls have been rehydrated on
the client (via inclusion of a simple script), the controls are otherwise
indistinguishable from controls created dynamically via JavaScript.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Utilities for common control needs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Sometimes a control needs to perform custom layout work, and such work may not
be possible until the control has been actually added to the DOM. (E.g., a
control may have zero height until it’s in the DOM.) Actually knowing when
something has been added to the DOM can be tricky, especially in different
browsers. QuickUI provides a cross-browser .inDocument() callback that lets a
control perform such custom work.
</li>
<li>
Similarly, QuickUI provides a cross-browser resize() event for controls that is
fired when the control’s size changes (e.g., in response to the user resizing
the window).
</li>
<li>
The jQuery Globalize library provides access to a number of culture-specific
details such as preferred formats for numbers, dates, and times. If the
Globalize library is included on a page, QuickUI controls have access to the
current culture via a .culture() property. This can be overridden on a
per-control basis to simplify testing of controls in various cultures.
</li> 
<li>
QuickUI provides several helper functions that combine a read-only jQuery
function and a write-only jQuery function into a single read/write getter/setter
property. E.g., jQuery’s read-only hasClass function and write-only toggleClass
function are combined to create an applyClass function. A similar function
provides an ability to both read and write a control’s visible state.
</li>
<li>
A propertyVector function that makes it easy to set the same property on
multiple controls while giving each control a different value for that property.
Conversely, the current value for a single property can be obtained from
multiple controls as an array.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI defines a :control selector that can be used to find controls or test to
see whether an element is a control. E.g., a jQuery call to find(“:control”)
will find all controls within a given jQuery context.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI provides an eachControl() looping construct that combines the function
of jQuery’s each() loop with automatic casting to the correct control type.
</li>
<li>
A catalog of common base controls allows developers to accelerate control
development by building upon (subclassing) existing functionality.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI provides control guidelines to facilitate the exchange of controls among
different organizations.
</li>
</ul>
