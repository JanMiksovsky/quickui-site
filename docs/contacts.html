The Contacts sample application demonstrates the use QuickUI as the user
interface framework for a typical web application. This page provides an
overview of the Contacts architecture. See the *** source code *** for complete
details.
</p>

*** SCREENSHOT ***

<h2>General notes on tools</h2>
<p>
The Contacts application shows just one possible set of tools; many other
combinations could be used to create the same Contacts application. In addition
to <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, which all QuickUI applications
depend upon, this particular sample Contacts implementation uses the following
tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a>. The
CoffeeScript language is an extension of JavaScript that allows, in most cases,
for more concise source code. CoffeeScript compiles to JavaScript, so
<i>everything that the sample does in CoffeeScript you could accomplish in plain
JavaScript</i>. CoffeeScript is used here because it's tighter than the
corresponding JavaScript. QuickUI lets you <a href="CoffeeScript.html">define
user interface components in CoffeeScript</a> using the language’s native
“class” syntax.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>.
The Backbone library provides a framework for constructing a typical Model-View-
Controller application, separating out representation of business objects (here,
contacts) from the user interface components used to edit them.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage">Backbone Local Storage</a>.
This Backbone plugin allows Contacts to store contact data locally.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>
is a CSS extension that simplifies the creation and maintenance of styles. The
LESS code used in Contacts borrows some utility functions and button styling
from <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">Grunt</a>
is a JavaScript-based build system. In the case of Contacts, Grunt handles
compiling the CoffeeScript to JavaScript and the LESS code to CSS.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://qunitjs.com/">Qunit</a>
is a standard unit testing framework for JavaScript applications like Contacts.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>General architecture</h2>
<p>
Like many modern applications, the Contacts sample application carefully
separates its representations of the data objects being viewed and manipulated
(the "Model") from the user interface doing that viewing and manipulation (the
"View").
</p>
<p>
Backbone applications like Contacts are often described as using a Model-View-Controller
architecture. In the case of the Contacts application, the entity
sitting between the View and Model behaves more like the Presenter in a Model-View-Presenter
arrangement. (See this article on
<a href="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/scaling-isomorphic-javascript-code">Scaling Isomorphic Javascript Code</a>
for a good comparison  a good comparison of MVC, MVP, and related
architectures). The main difference is that, in the Contacts application, the
View is not itself listening to events that indicate changes in the Model; the
Presenter listens to those events, then updates the View as appropriate.
</p>

<h2>Contact data models</h2>
<p>
The definition for the data Model classes in the Contacts application are quite
simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A <a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/models/Contact.coffee">Contact</a>
object holds the contact information for a single person. This defines a small
set of fields to hold a person’s name, email address, postal address, phone
number, and photo.
</li>
<li>
A <a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/models/Contacts.coffee">Contacts</a> collection holds a set of Contact objects. This class extends
the Backbone.Collection class, which does most of the work here. All the
Contacts collection has to do is declare that it holds Contact objects (above),
indicate that it wants to use local storage, and that contacts should be sorted
by name.
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/presenters/ContactsPresenter.coffee">ContactsPresenter</a></h2>
<p>
The ContactsPresenter class provides most of the wiring between the Contacts
collection (described above) and the main ContactsPage user interface class
(described below).
</p>
<p>
Example: When the user presses the New button in the Toolbar user interface
control, a custom “newContact” user interface event is raised. This bubbles up
to the level of the ContactsPage view, where it is detected by
ContactsPresenter. The presenter then tells the Contacts collection model to add
a new contact. The Contacts collection will eventually raise an “add” event of
its own, which will again be detected by the ContactsPresenter. In response, the
presenter tells the ContactsPage view to add the new contact to the list box.
Other view and model communication is handled similarly.
</p>

<p>
Backbone doesn't provide a base "Presenter" base class, but Backbone's own View
class makes a reasonably good base class for a presenter:
</p>
<pre>class window.ContactsPresenter extends Backbone.View</pre>
<p>
The real View in this application is provided by QuickUI controls like
ContactsPage. Deriving our presenter from the View base class does provide some
nice features, however: the presenter gets references to the model (the Contacts
collection) and to the real View (via the $el reference). In Backbone
applications, the $el member points to a jQuery reference. Because QuickUI
controls derive from jQuery, we can set $el to directly to a QuickUI control.
Another benefit of deriving our presenter from the View class is that we
automatically get event binding for events raised by the QuickUI controls which
constitute the View.
</p>
<p>
Some other notes on the presenter:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>
Backbone invokes the presenter’s render() function when the collection of
contacts is initially loaded. Because the ContactListBox control (below) can
directly render an array of contacts, the code for render() is a short but
powerful line of code:
</p>
<pre># Render all the contacts.
render: -&gt; @$el.contacts @contacts()</pre>
<p>
The righthand portion retrieves the <i>collection’s</i> array of contacts. The
portion in the middle passes this array directly to the contacts() setter on the
View, which is an instance of ContactsPage. ContactsPage is turn delegates this
call to ContactListBox. ContactListBox will iterate over this array, creating a
new ContactCard for each contact. In this way, the wiring responsible for
getting the view to render a complete collection of contact models is achieved
in a single line.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Backbone automatically keeps the Contacts collection sorted. For example, if the
collection fetched from local storage is not sorted, Backbone will sort them
before passing the collection to the presenter. When the user changes the name
of a contact, the contact’s position in the list will likely have to change to
maintain the sort order. However, it would be expensive to completely resort the
array and rebuild the entire list in response to a change in a single Contact.
Instead, the presenter optimizes handling of a contact rename: it removes the
affected card from the list box, finds the new position it belongs in, and
inserts the card back into the list box at that position.
</li>

<li>
As noted, the presenter manages the connection between the Contacts collection
model and the ContactsPage collection view. However, an individual Contact model
and the corresponding individual ContactCard view have their own relationship.
In this particular sample application, the ContactCard view has a direct
reference to the corresponding Contact model; the view is not forced to interact
with the model via the presenter.
</li>

<li>
In this sample application, the presenter also has the ability to perform some
debug operations on the collection of contacts: clearing the entire collection,
or loading a set of sample contacts.
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/ContactsPage.coffee">ContactsPage</a></h2>

*** DIAGRAM of overall ContactPage, with callouts ***

<p>
The ContactsPage is a QuickUI control that acts as the top-level View in the
Model-View-Presenter architecture. In this particular application, the
ContactsPage represents the entire end-user visible document in the browser, but
the View could just have easily been a control that represented only a portion
of the overall DOM tree. Some notes on ContactsPage:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
ContactsPage derives from the standard QuickUI Catalog base class called <a
data-control="CatalogLink">Page</a>, which handles some general page-level
services. In this case, it uses the Page.title() property to set the page’s
title shown in the browser, and uses Page.fill() to create a page that fills the
entire viewport.
</li>

<li>
Visually speaking, ContactsPage uses a <a data-
control="CatalogLink">VerticalPanel</a> control to divide the available real
estate into two regions: a persistent panel at the top for a toolbar, and a main
content area that consumes the remaining space. Significantly, the height of the
toolbar does <i>not</i> need to be known at design time. At runtime, VerticalPanel
will use either a CSS flexbox layout (if the user’s browser supports that) or a
manual layout engine (on an older browser) to ensure the toolbar region is the
appropriate height.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Beyond that, ContactsPage doesn’t do much work. The substance of the page is
actually implemented by ContactsListBox (described below), which visually
represents the set of contacts as business cards. However, to avoid exposing too
many implementation details to external entities such as the presenter,
ContactsPage <i>acts</i> as if it itself is managing the list of contacts. To acheive
this, ContactsPage exposes a small set of methods that mirror a portion of the
list box API, and delegates all those methods to the list box to do the actual
work. E.g., the line below exposes a contacts() property on ContactsPage that
delegates its value to the items() property of the list box:
</p>
<pre>
contacts: Control.chain "$contactListBox", "items"
</pre>
<p>
Here, the
<a href="control-class-methods.html#chain">Control.chain()</a>
helper function is used to concisely define a getter/setter function whose
value is retrieved from, or passed to, a property on an element within the
control.
</p>
<p>
In this way, the presenter can interact solely with the overall top-level
View (i.e., ContactsPage), and doesn’t need to have direct references to any
controls inside that view. An alternative implementation could use the
ContactsListBox as the top-level View, which might be simpler, although the
present arrangement is perhaps more future-proof. If, at any point in the
future, ContactsPage needs to do its own work in response to presenter activity
(e.g., show the number of contacts in the toolbar), it could do so without any
changes to the presenter.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/Toolbar.coffee">Toolbar</a></h2>
<p>
The Toolbar control takes care of populating the simple toolbar with a title and
some buttons. The only interesting aspect of the user interface here is that a
standard QuickUI Catalog control called
<a data-control="CatalogLink">PopupButton</a> is used to create a
dropdown menu of debug commands in a few lines of declarative 
<a href="control-JSON.html">Control JSON</a>:
</p>
<pre>{ control: PopupButton, ref: "buttonDebug", content: "Debug", popup: [
  { control: MenuItem, ref: "menuItemSamples", content: "Reload Sample Contacts" }
  { control: MenuItem, ref: "menuItemEraseAll", content: "Remove All" }
  { control: MenuSeparator }
  { control: MenuItem, ref: "menuAbout", content: "About This Application" }
]}</pre>
<p>
The Toolbar class also defines the "+" key (and, on Windows, the Insert key) as
a keyboard shortcut for the "New" button.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/ContactListBox.coffee">ContactListBox</a></h2>
<p>
This control is the user interface element responsible for actually representing
the overall collection of contacts. ContactListBox derives from
<a data-control="CatalogLink">ListBox</a>, which in turn inherits from
<a data-control="CatalogLink">List</a>,
a standard control for representing an array of items as controls. In this case,
ContactListBox will represent its items as ContactCard controls (described
below). All of this is extremely easy to arrange in declaring the ContactListBox
class:
</p>
<pre>class window.ContactListBox extends ListBox
  
  inherited:
    # Each item in the list should be represented as a ContactCard control.
    itemClass: "ContactCard"
    # The list item (the model) will be passed to a card's contact() property.
    mapFunction: "contact"</pre>

<p>
To the standard List behavior, ListBox base class adds selection semantics and
keyboard navigation:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The user can click a card to select it.
</li>

<li>
The user can press Up/Down (or Left/Right), Page Up/Page Down, and Home/End to
navigate the list.
</li>

<li>
The selected card is automatically scrolled into view, e.g., in response to
keyboard navigation. As the list is sorted by contact name, the selected card
can also change position if the user updates the name on a card and clicks Save.
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/Card.coffee">Card</a></h2>
<p>
This class is a simple container that renders as a small business card with
shadow effects. Most of this is achieved with styling. One set of style rules
are only applied when the “selected” CSS class is applied, which is
automatically applied to a card by the list box when a card becomes selected. A
card defines styles such that a card’s visual height is normally constrained,
but when selected the card will expand to show the card’s entire content.
</p>
<p>
One aspect of its visual appearance that is managed with a standard control is
the use of a <a data-control="CatalogLink">Fader</a> to fade out the card’s
content in the normal state if the content doesn’t completely fit.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/ContactCard.coffee">ContactCard</a></h2>

*** DIAGRAM of contact card, with callouts ***

<p>
This control is the primary representation of a contact in the user interface.
It subclasses Card (above) in order to gain that class’ visual presentation.
</p>

<pre>class window.ContactCard extends Card
  
  inherited:
    content:
      # The Mode control shows just one child (mode) at a time.
      control: Mode, ref: "mode", content: [
        { control: "DetailsRead", ref: "modeRead" }
        { control: "DetailsEdit", ref: "modeEdit" }
      ]</pre>

<p>
The Card and ContactCard classes could easily be combined into a single class,
but factoring this into two classes lets each class focus on a more limited set
of responsibilities. It would also make it easier to adapt the Card class for
other purposes.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
ContactCard has three states: normal (unselected), selected, and editing. The
first click on a contact in the normal state will move it into the selected
state. That job is handled by ListBox, because that need arises in many lists.
In this app, a click on a card in the selected state will move it into the
editing state.
</li>

<li>
In the normal and selected states, the card shows the contact information as
read-only fields. In the editing state, the card shows the same information in
editable text boxes. The ContactCard hosts a
<a data-control="CatalogLink">Mode</a>
control to switch between these two states. Each state is represented by a class
of its own: DetailsRead and DetailsEdit.
</li>

<li>
If the user clicks on a specific read-only field in the normal or selected
state, ContactCard will put the keyboard focus into the corresponding editable
field in the editing state.
</li>

<li>
The ContactCard class defines some keyboard shortcuts: pressing Enter in a
single-line input field saves the card, while pressing Esc cancels any pending
edits.
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/ContactDetails.coffee">ContactDetails</a></h2>
<p>
The read and edit user interface for a contact expose different controls, but
the two states do share some things:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
Both states use a simple two-column layout.
</li>

<li>
Both states expose the same external API. The main function of interest to a
host is a contact() property, which can set or get the contact associated with
the control. The contact() property in turn sets some more specific properties:
name(), address(), and so on.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
To implement these shared aspects, the ContactDetails class exists to serve as a
base class for the read state, DetailsRead, and the edit state,
DetailsEdit.
</p>
<p>
The ContactDetails class expects to be subclassed to provide a complete
implementation; it’s similar to an abstract class in many programming
languages. Specifically, the various contact properties for name(), address(),
etc., store their values in controls — but it’s up to a subclass to actually
decide what type of element or control will be used. This allows the read state
to represent the name() property with a simple div, while the edit state
represents the same name() property with a <a data-
control="CatalogLink">ValidatingTextBox</a>.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/DetailsRead.coffee">DetailsRead</a></h2>
<p>
This subclass of ContactDetails (above) is used to represent the contact in the
read state (when the card is unselected, or selected but not yet in editing
mode). It defines elements expected by ContactDetails that show the various
contact properties in read only elements or controls. E.g., the postal address()
property is shown in a PostalAddress control, which adds a link to Google Maps.
</p>
<p>
Because this handles the read state, the only interactivity defined by
DetailsRead is tracking whether the user has clicked a specific read-only
field. If the user clicks the name field, for instance, the control will raise
an fieldClick event. ContactCard uses this event to place the keyboard focus in
the corresponding editable field in DetailsEdit.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/DetailsEdit.coffee">DetailsEdit</a></h2>
<p>
The other subclass of ContactDetails, DetailsEdit, is used to edit the
information for a specific contact. This control entails the most domain-
specific interactivity (i.e., UI details which wouldn’t be found in any other
application), and hence has the longest source code of any of the controls in
the application. (Even then, it’s not particularly long.)
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The name field uses <a data-control="CatalogLink">ValidatingTextBox</a> to show
visual feedback indicating that a name is required. The ContactCard class uses
the valid() state of that text box to determine whether to enable the Save
button via the button’s disabled() property.
</li>

<li>
The address field uses the <a data-control="CatalogLink">AutoSizeTextBox</a>
class to allow the field to grow to contain its contents.
</li>

<li>
The photo field is currently read-only. (Including a working photo upload
service, etc., is beyond the scope of this sample application.)
</li>

<li>
For simplicity, this control directly invokes save() and destroy() methods on
the Contact model when appropriate. If it was desired to further separate the
View from the Model here, this interaction could be mediated through the
Presenter.
</li>

</ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui-contacts/blob/master/controls/FieldLauncher.coffee">FieldLauncher</a></h2>
<p>
In the card’s read-only states, two of the card fields, email address and postal
address, include little buttons next to them that use the field’s content to
launch a new window: a new email message or Google Maps, respectively. This
simple but shared behavior is encapsulated in the control class FieldLauncher.
This is actually a good example of a situation where, in an old-school
JavaScript application, a developer might have simply copy-and-pasted code
rather than going through the work of factoring out the common behavior into a
separate component. In QuickUI, creating and using a component is easy enough
that the “activation energy” required to trigger refactoring is extremely
low.
</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>
<p>
The Contacts sample application achieves a reasonably interesting visual
appearance and degree of interactivity in a fairly small amount of code.
</p>
<ul>

<li>
Building on top of general-purpose base classes from the <a
href="/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a> means that a significant portion of the user
interface code is actually shared. Broadly speaking, over half (about 60%) of
the code which defines the appearance and interactivity of this sample
application is shared. Conversely, less than half of the UI code (about 40%) is
unique to this application. This balance is consistent with other component-
based applications created with QuickUI.
</li>
<li>
QuickUI controls can easily and cleanly fill the role of a View in an MVC/MVP
application architecture. In this case, they work very well on top of a Model
and Presenter created in Backbone.
</li>
<li>
You can create QuickUI controls in CoffeeScript very concisely.
</li>
<li>
Building a user interface with components like QuickUI controls makes it easy
to iterate on the design and implementation. During the development of this
sample Contacts application, many aspects of the design evolved. Having the
UI packaged in modular components, with a clean separation of concerns, made it
easy to carry out design changes: the relevant component could be identified
quickly, and changes made to the component rarely had ramifications outside the
local context of the control.
</li>

</ul>
