<title>Control JSON</title>

</head>

<body data-create-controls="true" data-control="DocumentationPage">

<p>
This page describes the Control JSON format which is used to by the
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/control-class-methods.html#subclass">Control.subclass()</a>
method to define a new class' property values. Control JSON is effectively a
JavaScript analogue to HTML markup â€” both allow you to define the content of
a user interface.
</p>

<p>
The Control JSON format allows you to concisely define two things: 1) a few
fields governing your class' definition, and 2) the default property
values for a new instance of the class. For example, in the following code:
</p>

<pre>
var OkButton = BasicButton.subclass({
    className: "OkButton",
    content: "OK"
});
</pre>

<p>
The key "className:" is a reserved key that defines the name of the new class.
The key "content:" is used to set the default value of a new instance's 
content() property to the text "OK".
</p>

<h2>Reserved JSON keys</h2>
<p>
There are only a handful of reserved keys at the top level of a Control JSON
object:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>className:</b> defines the string name for the new class. This is
        applied as a DOM element class name to new control instances, allowing
        them to be styled with CSS. This name is also useful for debugging.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>prototype:</b> defines any members that should be added to the
        new class' prototype. This is where you will typically define new
        control properties and other methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>tag:</b> defines the HTML element type which will be used as the
        root for new control instances. By default, this is a
        <span data-control="Tag">div</span>, but you can set it to another
        type if you wish.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Defining default property values for a new control instance</h2>
<p>
All keys at the top level of a Control JSON object are interpreted as the names
of control properties. The values corresponding to these keys will be passed
to the corresponding property setters. This system allows you define the default
values which your new class will assign to control instances it creates.
</p>
<p>
For example, using the OkButton class definition above, the content() property
for a new OkButton instance will be set, by default, to the string "OK". 
</p>
<pre>
var button = OkButton.create();
var s = button.content(); // "OK"
</pre>

<p>
Default values defined in the JSON passed to subclass() are actually set by
invoking properties on the <i>base</i> class. The above definition for
OkButton sets the default value by calling the content() property defined
by its base class BasicButton. This allows a class to set its own default
content, while simultaneously allowing the class to define a custom content()
property whose definition overrides its base class' implementation.
For an example of how that might work, see the tutorial exercise on
<a data-control="Link" href="/tutorial/overriding-content-property.html">Defining your control's content property</a>.
</p>

<h2>Control JSON value types</h2>
<p>
The values in a Control JSON object can take one of the following forms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        String, integer, or other fundamental JavaScript type. Such a value
        will be used as is. Setting a control's content() property to a string
        representing HTML will typically place the correspoding HTML elements
        into the DOM.
    </li>
    <li>
        An array of Control JSON objects. Each item in the array will be
        processed in turn.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Control JSON object starting with an "html:" key.
        This will result in the creation of a plain jQuery object.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Control JSON object starting with a "control:" key. This will
        create an instance of a QuickUI control of the designated class.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The latter two value types are described in more detail below.
</p>

<h2>Creating jQuery objects with the "html:" key</h2>
Suppose that you are creating a control, and somewhere within it
you want to create a div using the following jQuery code: 
</p>
<pre>
$( "&lt;div/&gt; ")
    .height( "250px" )
    .width( "300px" );
</pre>
<p>
The above procedural JavaScript can be represented declaratively as data in Control
JSON as follows:
</p>
<pre>
{
    html: "div",
    height: "250px",
    width: "300px"
}
</pre>
<p>
The first "html:" key indicates that you want to create a new jQuery object
using the specified HTML. (In normal jQuery, a single tag like "div" selects
divs, rather than creating a div; the longer "&lt;div>" is required. As a
convenience, Control JSON permits the use of the shorter "div".)  
The "height:" and "width:" keys which follow
indicate that you want to apply the height() and width() setters as a chain.
</p>

<h2>Creating QuickUI control instances with the "control:" key</h2>
<p>
Similarly, a "control:" key can be used to instantiate QuickUI controls:
</p>
<pre>
{
    control: Collapsible,
    heading: "Today's photo",
    content: {
        control: FlickrInterestingPhoto,
        photoSize: "m"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This JSON creates a
<a data-control="CatalogLink">FlickrInterestingPhoto</a>
control nested within a
<a data-control="CatalogLink">Collapsible</a>
control. It also sets the Collapsible's heading() property, and the photo's
photoSize() property.
</p>

<h2>Setting IDs on DOM elements and controls</h2>
<p>
If a Control JSON object starting with "html:" or "control:" also contains an
"id:" key, the resulting element or control will have the indicated string
value applied as a DOM ID. As a secondary effect, the control <i>class</i> being
defined (<i>not</i> the control instance being created) will have an element
reference function generated for it. This function will permit quick access
to the indicated element at runtime.
</p>
<p>
See
<a data-control="Link" href="http://quickui.org/tutorial/element-reference-functions.html">Using functions to reference elements within a control</a>
for more discussion and an interactive example.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of using JSON to define a control's appearance</h2>
<p>
The data-driven approach to using JSON to generate UI arguably has
advantages over the equivalent procedural JavaScript code:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The JSON doesn't allow for fancy coding tricks or idioms.
        Such techniques can result in compact, efficient code, but at a loss
        of legibility.
        Reading someone <i>else's</i> jQuery code can be challenging; there's a
        good chance they will populate the DOM by some means other than what
        you yourself would have written. Control JSON, in contrast, requires
        you to create a UI declaratively, with static data. In the long run,
        this approach tends to produce UI code which is easier to read and maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Control JSON directly reflects the structure of the DOM it will create.
        With old-school HTML, it's easy to visualize the structure of the DOM
        the markup will produce at runtime. Similarly, the hierarchical nature
        of JSON makes it easy to visualize the resulting UI.
    </li>
    <li>
        JSON is more parsable tool-able than arbitrary JavaScript. This enables
        tools which generate or transform UI code.
    </li>
</ul>
