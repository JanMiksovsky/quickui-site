<title>Control JSON</title>

</head>

<body data-create-controls="true" data-control="DocumentationPage">

<p>
The Control JSON format is used by control classes to define values they wish
to set on parent classes when rendering new control instances. Control JSON is
effectively a JavaScript analogue to HTML markup â€” both allow you to declaratively
define the content of a user interface.
</p>
<p>
Control JSON is used to process the "inherited" member set on a class' prototype.
This is typically set by passing an object with an "inherited:" key to a call
to
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/control-class-methods.html#subclass">Control.sub()</a>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following code defines a new subclass of the BasicButton class:
</p>

<pre>
var OKButton = BasicButton.sub({
    className: "OKButton",
    inherited: {
        content: "OK"        
    }
});
</pre>

<p>
The values passed to sub() will be copied to the new class' prototype. In this
case, the name "OKButton" will be set as the className on the prototype. The
static "inherited" value is likewise copied to the prototype. That sub-object
will be processed as Control JSON using the rules defined here.
</p>

<h2>Control JSON keys invoke control property setters</h2>
<p>
All keys at the top level of a Control JSON object are interpreted as the names
of control properties. The values corresponding to these keys will be passed
to the corresponding property setters. This system allows you define the default
values which your new class will assign to control instances it creates.
</p>
<p>
For example, using the OkButton class definition above, the content() property
for a new OkButton instance will be set, by default, to the string "OK". 
</p>
<pre>
var button = OkButton.create();
var s = button.content(); // returns "OK"
</pre>

<p>
Default values defined in Control JSON are actually set by invoking property
setters on the <i>base</i> class. The above definition for
OKButton sets the default value by calling the content() property defined
by its base class BasicButton. This allows a class to set its own default
content, while simultaneously allowing the class to define a custom content()
property whose definition overrides its base class' implementation.
For an example of how that might work, see the tutorial exercise on
<a data-control="Link" href="/tutorial/overriding-content-property.html">Defining your control's content property</a>.
</p>

<h2>Control JSON value types</h2>
<p>
The values in a Control JSON object can take one of the following forms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        String, integer, or other fundamental JavaScript type. Such a value
        will be used as is. (E.g., the "OK" string above will not receive
        any further processing.) 
        Setting a control's content() property to a string
        representing HTML will typically place the correspoding HTML elements
        into the DOM.
    </li>
    <li>
        An array of Control JSON objects. Each item in the array will be
        processed in turn.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Control JSON object starting with an "html:" key.
        This will result in the creation of a plain jQuery object.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Control JSON object starting with a "control:" key. This will
        create an instance of a QuickUI control of the designated class.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
The latter two value types are described in more detail below.
</p>

<h2>Creating jQuery objects with the "html:" key</h2>
Suppose that you are creating a control, and somewhere within it
you want to create a div using the following jQuery code: 
</p>
<pre>
$( "&lt;div/&gt; ")
    .height( "250px" )
    .width( "300px" );
</pre>
<p>
The above procedural JavaScript can be represented declaratively as data in Control
JSON as follows:
</p>
<pre>
{
    html: "div",
    height: "250px",
    width: "300px"
}
</pre>
<p>
The first "html:" key indicates that you want to create a new jQuery object
using the specified HTML. (In normal jQuery, a single tag like "div" selects
divs, rather than creating a div; the longer "&lt;div>" is required. As a
convenience, Control JSON permits the use of the shorter "div".)  
The "height:" and "width:" keys which follow
indicate that you want to apply the height() and width() setters as a chain.
</p>

<h2>Creating QuickUI control instances with the "control:" key</h2>
<p>
Similarly, a "control:" key can be used to instantiate QuickUI controls:
</p>
<pre>
{
    control: Collapsible,
    heading: "Today's photo",
    content: {
        control: FlickrInterestingPhoto,
        photoSize: "m"
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This JSON creates a
<a data-control="CatalogLink">FlickrInterestingPhoto</a>
control nested within a
<a data-control="CatalogLink">Collapsible</a>
control. It also sets the Collapsible's heading() property, and the photo's
photoSize() property.
</p>

<h2>Setting the "ref:" key on DOM elements and controls</h2>
<p>
If a Control JSON object starting with "html:" or "control:" also contains an
"ref:" key, the resulting element or control will have the indicated string
value applied as a CSS class. As a secondary effect, the control <i>class</i>
being defined (<i>not</i> the control instance being created) will have an element
reference function generated for it. This function will permit quick access
to the indicated element at runtime.
</p>
<p>
See
<a data-control="Link" href="http://quickui.org/tutorial/element-reference-functions.html">Using functions to reference elements within a control</a>
for more discussion and an interactive example.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of using Control JSON to define a control's appearance</h2>
<p>
The data-driven approach to using JSON to generate UI arguably has
advantages over the equivalent procedural JavaScript code:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Control JSON doesn't allow for fancy coding tricks or idioms.
        Such techniques can result in compact, efficient code, but at a loss
        of legibility.
        Reading someone <i>else's</i> jQuery code can be challenging; there's a
        good chance they will populate the DOM by some means other than what
        you yourself would have written. Control JSON, in contrast, requires
        you to create a UI declaratively, with static data. In the long run,
        this approach tends to produce UI code which is easier to read and maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Control JSON directly reflects the structure of the DOM it will create.
        With old-school HTML, it's easy to visualize the structure of the DOM
        the markup will produce at runtime. Similarly, the hierarchical nature
        of JSON makes it easy to visualize the resulting UI.
    </li>
    <li>
        Control JSON is more parsable and tool-able than arbitrary JavaScript.
        This enables the creation of design-time and compile-time tools that can
        generate or transform UI code.
    </li>
</ul>
