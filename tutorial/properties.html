<b>Core idea:</b> You can manipulate the appearance and behavior of controls
through properties. Properties are implemented as standard jQuery-style
getter/setter functions. You can also set multiple properties through a property
dictionary.
</p>
<p>
The content() property shown previously is just one standard control property —
controls can expose any number of properties to let you manipulate their content
and behavior. Some control properties may map directly to contents of elements 
in the control’s DOM subtree, or to aspects (e.g., CSS style attributes) of 
those elements. Other control properties may be stored internally for later use
by the control, e.g., to govern the control’s response to events.
</p>
<p>
Following jQuery convention, the setter form of a property function is
chainable, meaning that you can continue applying additional instance functions
to it. Also following jQuery convention, the setter form of a property function 
can manipulate an array of controls in a single call. This makes it easy for you
to quickly manipulate collections of similar controls, e.g., all the controls in 
a list.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can also define a property dictionary to set multiple properties on
a control at once, such as during the create call. So
MyControl.create().foo(1).bar(2) is equivalent to
MyControl.create({ foo: 1, bar: 2 }).
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> creates a collapsible panel, then invokes several property
setters on the resulting control instance. The first call is to the standard
jQuery css() setter function to apply some styling to the control. The calls
which follow invoke the standard content() setter, as well as setter functions
unique to this control class. The content() and heading() properties directly
populate portions of the control’s DOM tree. The duration() property, in 
contrast, stores its value for later use. In this case, the value determines the
animation speed in response to a heading button click.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> The CollapsibleWithHeadingButton class has two properties,
expandedButtonContent and collapsedButtonContent, which define the
state-depended content of the little button in the control’s upper-right corner. 
By default, these properties are the minus sign (“–”) and plus sign (“+”),
respectively. Override these defaults by setting these properties to something 
else, such as the strings “Hide” and “Show”.
