<b>Core idea:</b>
QuickUI controls are defined with regular JavaScript classes. You can factor
your UI so that each control class has a specific responsibility, simplifying
development and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
As a JavaScript developer, you already use JavaScript’s native class support to
define reusable behavior. QuickUI control classes are simply JavaScript classes. 
There are several ways to instantiate of a control class. The simplest is to
invoke its create() method, which returns a control instance that you can then
add to the DOM.
</p>
<p>
You can do anything to a control class or control instance that you can normally
do in JavaScript. You can extend the class’s behavior by extending its
prototype; you can test whether a control instance is a member of a given class
with the JavaScript “instanceof” keyword; and so on.
</p>
<p>
As with any object-oriented system, each control class has a specific
responsibility. This is called separation of concerns: each class overlaps the
functionality of other classes as little as possible. A class can inherit from
another class, creating something more optimized for a more specialized task.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> 
creates several instances of a related control classes. The
<a data-control="CatalogLink">PopupSource</a>
class is extremely rudimentary, and simply pops up an element when clicked on.
The PopupSource class forms the basis for a more specialized subclass called
<a data-control="CatalogLink">ComboBox</a>,
which adds a text input element and a dropdown button that invokes the popup.
ComboBox is further specialized to create
<a data-control="CatalogLink">ListComboBox</a>,
which can show a set of items as a dropdown list; it also adds AutoComplete.
Finally, <a data-control="CatalogLink">ColorSwatchComboBox</a>
is a specialized ListComboBox which adds a small color swatch to each list item.
</p>
<p>
Each of these classes has a specific role to play. They each inherit all the
functionality of their parent classes; for example, a ColorSwatchComboBox can 
do everything a ListComboBox can, only more specialized to work with colors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Override the default set of colors shown by the
ColorSwatchComboBox by setting its items() property. That class inherits its
items() property from ListComboBox. Looking at how the items() property is set
on the ListComboBox, add a similar call to set the items() of the
ColorSwatchComboBox. This can be any array of CSS color names. The combo box
will show a dropdown list of color swatches for each named color, and will
AutoComplete against these names as well.
