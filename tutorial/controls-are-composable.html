<b>Core idea:</b>
You can easily combine controls to create a user interface.
</p>
<p>
It’s rare to find a user interface that’s best implemented as a single,
monolithic chunk of code. Rather, a typical user interface can usually be
decomposed into pieces, which can themselves be decomposed, and so on. The 
smaller the components, the more fundamental and general in nature they tend to
be.
</p>
<p>
Because QuickUI controls are generally designed to be
<a data-control="Link" href="context-independent.html">context independent</a>,
it’s possible to recombine controls in new ways and still have the 
constituent parts work correctly. For example, the controls in the
<a data-control="Link" href="/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</a>
all have a specific role to play, and are designed to be incorporated in novel
ways to create a user interface.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> 
creates one of the QuickUI Catalog controls,
<a data-control="CatalogLink">DateComboBox</a>,
which is designed to let users pick a single date by typing or navigating a
dropdown month calendar. DateComboBox is in its own right, but is not delievered
as a monolithic piece of functionality. Rather, it’s composed of other Catalog
controls that can each be used independently or combined in new ways.
</p>
<p>
Below the DateComboBox you see some of its component parts. These aren’t wired
together yet, but simply demonstrate some of the pieces you can build with
to construct your own user interface elements.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a data-control="CatalogLink">DateTextBox</a>, a text box that
        ensures its contents are a valid date in short date format.
        This is used for a DateComboBox’s text input portion.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a data-control="CatalogLink">CalendarMonthNavigator</a>,
        an inline calendar that lets a user navigate by month to select a date.
        This is used for a DateComboBox’s dropdown.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a data-control="CatalogLink">MonthName</a>,
        which shows the name of the month for a given date.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a data-control="CatalogLink">DaysOfWeek</a>,
        which can show the names of the days of the week in a variety of formats.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
By default these components support standard U.S. English date formats, but they
are all localizable through the
<a data-control="Link" href="https://github.com/jquery/globalize">Globalize</a>
library.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> 
Add a <a data-control="CatalogLink">CalendarMonth</a>
control to the end of the demo. This is the main component of a
CalendarMonthNavigator, which in turn is the main component of a DateComboBox.
Subsequent exercises will explain how
you can begin giving controls the behavior they’d need to work together. By
visually arranging and wiring together these components, it would be possible to
build your own date picker control or some other date-related user interface.
