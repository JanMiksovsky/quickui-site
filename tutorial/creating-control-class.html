<b>Core idea:</b>
QuickUI makes it easy for you to package up content, styling, and behavior as a
reusable control class. You can do this by calling the function
Control.sub(), passing in a JSON dictionary defining default values for
various class properties. The result of this call will be your new control
class: a JavaScript class that you can instantiate as part of a user interface.
</p>
<p>
The
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/control-class-methods.html#sub">Control.sub()</a>
method does its core work via a jQuery method called
<a data-control="Link" href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/">sub()</a>,
which
implements a standard JavaScript prototype-based inheritance scheme. Your class
will inherit a large set of standard behavior from the base Control class. Since
<a data-control="Link" href="inheritFromJQuery.html">Control inherits from jQuery</a>,
your new class will also inherit all of jQuery’s abilities.
</p>
<p>
The sub() call permits a single parameter: a JavaScript object whose values
will be copied to the new class' prototype. That is, these values will be
available on all new instances of the class you're defining.
For example, you will typically supply a “className:” key to define the name for
the new control class, which will be applied as a CSS class to all controls
created by the class (see
<a data-control="Link" href="cssClasses.html">CSS class names</a>.) You can
also define properties and methods which you want to make available on all
instances of your new class.
</p>
<p>
One special member of this object passed to sub() has the key “inherited:”.
This takes the form of a JavaScript sub-object in
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/control-JSON.html">Control JSON</a> format.
Briefly, this format lets you define, in a declarative, data-driven way, the
initial content of a control. Any keys in that “inherited:” sub-object will
invoke property setters on your new object. That is, an entry of the form foo:
“bar” will cause the base class property foo() to be invoked with value “bar”.
</p>
<p>
The result of calling sub() is typically stored in a global JavaScript
variable with the same identifier as the control’s class name. It’s this form of 
the name that you will reference directly in your JavaScript code.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> creates a new control class called Greet that will be a
subclass of the base Control class. The “className:” key in the JavaScript
object sets the class’ name to “Greet”. The “inherited:” key indicates that
new instances of the Greet class should have their content() property set to
the indicated value. The result of the sub() call is stored in a JavaScript
variable with the identifier Greet.
</p>
<p>
The Greet.create() calls that follow add three instances of the new Greet class
to the demo. However, since Greet currently has no meaningful pre-defined
content, the three controls don’t appear to be visible.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b>
Add default content to Greet controls by giving the “content:” key a string
value like “Hello, world!”
</p>
<p>
When Greet.create() is called, a plain instance of the base Control class is
created. The string you specify will then be passed to the Control class’
content() property, which will insert the text into the control’s top element. 
When the resulting elements are passed to $demo.append(), you end up seeing
three copies of the text.
</p>
