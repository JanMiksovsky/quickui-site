<title>Casting a DOM element reference to a control class instance</title>

<b>Core idea:</b> The QuickUI control() plugin can be invoked on the element at
the top of a control’s DOM subtree to retrieve the logical control object that
put that element there. This control reference is automatically cast to the
correct JavaScript class for you, so that you end up with full access to the 
control’s features via plain JavaScript function calls.
</p>
<p>
A logical control object is an invisible entity distinct from the tree of DOM
elements that may make up its visual manifestation. In casual parlance, the 
term “control” can refer to either the logical entity or the visual tree, or 
even both these things together. During coding, however, it’s essential to
understand which aspect of a control — logical or visual — you’re dealing with.
</p>
<p>
To go from a logical control object to the top of its DOM element tree is 
straightforward: as discussed earlier, a control object is itself a jQuery array
that contains a reference to the control’s top-level DOM element.
</p>
<p>
To go the other way, from a DOM element to the corresponding logical control, 
first use a jQuery selector to obtain a jQuery object referencing the DOM
element in question. You can then convert, or “cast”, that object to a more
specific class by invoking a jQuery plugin called control(). If the element in
question was the top element created by a control, then the control() plugin 
will return an instance of that control class. This will be a jQuery instance
exposing the full functionality of the control. (If the element in question is
not the top element of a control, passing the element to control() will return
null.)
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> doesn’t work initially. It uses jQuery’s find() function to
retrieve a reference to the div at the root of the button. (This div is 
created implicitly by the BasicButton.create() call.) That result of the 
find() will be of type jQuery. Since there’s no jQuery function called
content(), the call to $element.content() fails.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Invoke control() on the result of the find() to cast the
jQuery reference to an instance of BasicButton. You will then be able to get the
content() of the resulting object.
