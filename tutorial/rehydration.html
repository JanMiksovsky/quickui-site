<b>Core idea:</b> For search engine visibility, controls can be created from
static HTML pages created by any means (an HTML authoring tool, a CMS, etc.) by
marking up HTML tags and then “rehydrating” them into live controls.
</p>
<p>
Search engines only crawl static HTML content, not live JavaScript controls. For
pages which are generally document-like, you can achieve SEO (Search Engine 
Optimization) benefits by writing HTML in normal means and including extra 
information that can be used later to quickly create a corresponding collection
of live controls. This process is called “rehydration”, and is accomplished with 
a QuickUI function called rehydrate().
</p>
<p>
The rehydrate() function looks for any elements with the data attribute
“data-control”. The value of this attribute should be the string name of a
QuickUI control class; this will be the class of the control from the
HTML element.
</p>

<p>
There are three ways to set properties on a control during rehydration:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    A data-<i>foo</i> attribute on the tag will pass the value of that
    attribute to the control’s foo() property. E.g., in the demo,
    data-paragraphs=”3” will invoke
    paragraphs(3) on the newly-created LoremIpsum control.
    </li>
    <li>
    To set complex properties in static HTML,
    create a child and set its “data-property” attribute to the string name of the
    property you want to set. In the demo, the first child, with 
    data-property=”heading”, will have its HTML contents passed to the control’s
    heading() setter.
    </li>
    <li>
    Any remaining child elements (i.e., those without a data-property attribute)
    will be passed to the new control’s content() property.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> populates an element with a set of static HTML div
elements, then invokes the QuickUI rehydrate() function to turn these into live
controls. For demo purposes, the static elements are added through JavaScript; 
in normal practice, you would author the static elements in whatever
manner you currently used to create HTML content: an HTML editor, a content
management system, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Update the static HTML so that the Cancel button’s disabled()
property is set to true when the control is rehydrated. Use either method #1
or method #2 above.
</p>
