<b>Core idea:</b>
When defining a class, you can use JSON to populate the default content of a new
control. A simple JSON format allows you to create plain text, HTML elements, or
QuickUI controls. The UI created in JSON will be passed to the control’s
content() property setter (or any other property you indicate). This makes
defining content quite concise, and makes it easier to visualize the result of 
creating a control instance.
</p>
<p>
The content of most controls will obviously vary from instance to instance – if
you have six radio buttons on a page, they probably have different labels. But
in most cases at least some portion of a control’s content is consistent and can 
be determined at design time. Modern JavaScript web applications often build
their entire UI in jQuery calls, but such procedural code can be hard for other
people (or even you, later) to wade through. Using a standard JSON format to
capture the consistent structure of a control’s UI can make things easier to 
read and maintain than raw procedural code.
</p>
<p>
The demo code creates a simple UI for a message composition feature. The code
illustrates the various means of using JSON to define the control class’ UI. A
control’s content() property, and other properties that accept a DOM subtree, 
can be filled out by adding a key to the JSON dictionary and giving this key a
value that’s either a string or an array. If it’s a string, it’s passed directly 
to the corresponding control property. So a dictionary entry like content:
“Hello” will invoke content(“Hello”) when a new control is created.
</p>
<p>
If the key value is an array (as here, in the value for “content:”), each item
of the array should take one of the following forms:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A string. This can be plain text or HTML. This will be added to the DOM
        as is. For example, the “<br/>” item in the demo is plain HTML.
    </li>
    <li>
        A nested dictionary containing an “html:” key. The value of this key
        should be HTML specifying a single element (which itself can contain
        subelements). This will be turned into a DOM element by jQuery. Any 
        additional keys in the nested dictionary will be taken as jQuery setters
        that should be invoked on the resulting DOM element. E.g., the demo code 
        creates an h2 element, and then invokes the jQuery css() function to set
        its color.
    </li>
    <li>
        A nested dictionary containing a “control:” key. The value of this key
        should be the string name of a QuickUI control class (with quotes:
        “BasicButton”), or a JavaScript identifier referring to a QuickUI
        control class (without quotes: BasicButton). The AutoSizeTextBox and
        BasicButton items below demonstrate this form. As with the above form,
        additional keys in the nested dictionary will invoke property setters.
        So after the BasicButton is created, the value “Send” will be passed to
        its content() setter.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
The JSON format is recursive, allowing controls be created within controls, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b>
creates the user interface for a simple message composer.
The JSON passed to subclass() creates some HTML elements and controls.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> 
Change the minimum size of the AutoSizeTextBox by adding an item after the line
“control: AutoSizeTextBox”. The new line should pass a value of, say, 5 to the
control’s minimumLines property. With this in place, the text box will start out
five lines tall, then grow as necessary when the user types.
</p>
