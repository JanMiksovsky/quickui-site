<b>Core idea:</b>
If control initialization code requires that a control instance be in the page
DOM, wrap the code in a callback function. Pass the callback to the control’s
inDocument() method to queue the callback for execution.
</p>
<p>
The
<a data-control="Link" href="initialize.html">initialize()</a>
method runs as soon as a control is instantiated, but some tasks may require a
control to actually be in the page DOM. For example, layout properties such as
height() and width(), and any properties related to CSS, will return useless
values if invoked before the control is in the document.
</p>
<p>
The base Control class supplies a method called inDocument that accepts a
callback function. If the control is already in the document, the callback is
executed immediately. If the control is still outside the DOM, the callback is
queued up; when the control is later added to the DOM, the callback will be
invoked.
</p>
<p>
Inside the callback, “this” refers to the control that was (just) added to the
DOM.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> 
creates a Square control that tries to initialize itself to be as tall as it is
wide. The code doesn’t work yet, because the initialize() function is invoked as
soon as the control is created – before the control is in the DOM and has a
known width. At that point the width will be zero, so the initialize() function
will set the height of the control to zero.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b>
Wrap the line that sets this.height() inside a callback function that is passed
to this.inDocument(). When the control is created, the callback will be queued
up. When the Square instance is added to the DOM in the $demo.append() call, the
callback will be invoked. At that point, the control will have a known width,
and should be able to set its height such that the resulting control is square.
