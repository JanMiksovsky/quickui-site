<b>Core idea:</b>
Your control code needs a quick and reliable way to manipulate the HTML
sub-elements or sub-controls a control contains. To this end, QuickUI can
automatically generate element reference functions for any element whose ID is
specified in the JSON. An element reference function always returns the
indicated element, even if another element with the same ID has been added to 
the DOM. This avoids a large class of name collisions, simplifying the
integration of controls from multiple authors.
</p>
<p>
To have a control access a contained element, one could give that element a
unique ID or DOM class name, then use a jQuery selector to find that elements on 
demand. However, by nature, controls often host other controls whose
construction may be unknown and outside your control. Those controls may
themselves contain elements whose IDs or class names conflict with the ones you
have chosen. Such naming collisions can cause controls to break when combined in
new ways, defeating the goal of
<a data-control="Link" href="context-independent.html">having controls be context independent</a>.
</p>
<p>
To address this problem, QuickUI gives you a reliable way to refer to elements
within a control. In the JSON which defines your control class’s initial DOM,
assign an ID to any HTML element or sub-control by including an “id:” key in the 
nested dictionary for that element or sub-control. This will have two effects. 
First, the element will have its DOM ID set to “foo” (and can therefore be 
selected or styled with “#foo” as usual). Second, and more importantly, a
function called $foo() will automatically be generated for your control class.
</p>
<p>
The instant the QuickUI framework creates that #foo element at runtime, it will
store a reference to it in the control’s per-instance data. Invoking $foo() on
that control will return the control’s copy of the #foo element. This runtime
lookup is done by reference, not by searching by ID, so it works even when other 
elements with the same ID have been added within the control’s subtree.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> 
creates a simple user tile class such as might be found on a social networking
site. A tile includes a photo – for demo purposes, this will be a random photo –
and a span to hold the user’s name. The code then creates three user tile
controls, and searches through these for the spans that have ID “#name”. It
directly manipulates these spans to give each tile a different user name.
</p>
<p>
This works – for now. But what if the author of FlickrInterestingPhoto decides
to give that control a sub-element with id #name? The attempt to search for name
spans by ID would inadvertently pick up unintended elements inside
FlickrInterestingPhoto. It’s better to avoid the potential for a naming
collision.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> 
Rewrite this code to use an element reference function to reliably manipulate
the name span. First, remove the id='name' attribute from the “html:” line and
turn that into an id: "name" item on a subsequent line in the same nested
dictionary. This will make the ID visible to the subclass() call. The indicated 
ID will be set on the element, but moreover, a new $name() function will be
created that always returns the indicated element.
</p>
<p>
With that in place, replace the find("#name") calls with calls to $name().
