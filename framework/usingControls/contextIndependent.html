<b>Core idea:</b> A control doesn’t generally need to know anything about its
host elements, the elements it sits within. Neither does a control depend on
other elements previously added to the DOM. The control itself normally provides
all the elements it needs to function, as well as basic styling. Additionally,
most controls generally impose few or no restrictions on the type of content
they can hold.
</p>
<p>
When a control instance is created, a DOM element is created to serve as the
top, or root, of the control’s elements. This top element is usually a
<span data-control="Tag">div</span>,
although a control class can ask for a different element. The control class
and its parent classes may then populate this element with any other
elements they require. The control’s subtree of elements is returned as the
result of the create() call. You can then add the subtree to the document
via a jQuery call like append(), or do anything else to it.
</p>
<p>
Controls are normally defined such that they can be added anywhere without
breaking or otherwise affecting other aspects of the page. This makes it very
easy to nest a control inside of another control, which in turn makes it easy
to quickly refactor a user interface.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> creates two adjacent controls: one showing a random photo from
Flickr’s Interestingness collection, and a CollapsibleWithHeadingButton panel
that can be toggled between a collapsed and an expanded state. Each control
adds all the elements it needs to the DOM. These controls could be added
anywhere on any page and, in principle, the controls would not need to be
modified for the new situation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Move the call that creates the photo so that it sits <i>inside</i>
the content of the collapsible control, instead of sitting just below it.
You will then be able to collapse or
expand the section containing the photo. (If you're curious, you can also prove
the point that controls are generally context-independent by swapping the heading 
and content values, so that the photo ends up in the <i>heading</i>.)
