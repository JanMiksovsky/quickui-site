<p>
As a JavaScript developer, you already use JavaScript’s native class support to define reusable behavior. In QuickUI, when you’re creating a new kind of control, you’re creating a JavaScript class. You can define control behavior through instance methods and class methods as regular JavaScript functions. Everything about working with controls is the same as working with classes: e.g., you can test whether an instance of a control class is a member of class with the standard “instanceof” keyword.
</p>
<p>
To use a given control class, you instantiate that class. There are several ways to do this, but the simplest is to invoke the .create() method shown earlier.
</p>
<p>
This page creates a instance of the ColorSwatchComboBox control class by calling the class' .create()  method. The page then shows that that control is an instance of ColorSwatchComboBox. The ColorSwatchComboBox class happens to inherit from a class called ListComboBox, so any color swatch combo box is also an instance of ListComboBox.
</p>
<p>
<b>Your goal:</b>
The ColorSwatchComboBox class derives from a class called ListComboBox, which in turn derives from a base class ComboBox, and ultimately from a base class called Control. Update the tests below
to convince yourself that a color swatch combo box is also an instance of the ComboBox class and the Control class.
