<!--

Welcome to the QuickUI tutorial. This tutorial is a sequence of "fiddles" -- mini web pages with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS -- that demonstrate the basics of using QuickUI. Each page of the tutorial
shows a basic QuickUI concept, and gives you a goal of something to try yourself.

This page loads the jQuery framework, plus three JavaScript and CSS resources (see the "Manage Resources" pane on the left): the quickui.js file for the framework itself, plus .js and .css files for the QuickUI Catalog of common controls.

The code in the JavaScript pane (below) creates two instances of the QuickUI Catalog control called BasicButton, and sets the content of each to a text label. The result of these calls will be two control instances, which are then handed to the jQuery $.append() function to add the controls to a div on the page. The buttons will react to mouse events, but don't do anything else yet.
