<title>Adding content to a control</title>

    ColorSwatchButton.create(),

<p class="highlight">
<b>Core idea:</b> Every control class has a content() property which, by
convention, refers to the main user-visible information rendered within the
control.
</p>
<p>
QuickUI properties emulate jQuery’s pervasive use of getter/setter functions: a
single function that can either get or set a value, depending on whether an
argument is supplied. The getter form has no arguments, and will return the
given property value for the first element in the jQuery object it’s applied to.
The setter form takes a single argument, and will set that property to that
value on every element in the jQuery object it’s applied to.
</p>
<p>
The semantics of the “content” property vary from control class to control
class. The base Control class defines a standard implementation of the content()
getter/setter function, but a control class can override this. Most controls
take anything passed to content() and stash it within an element somewhere in
the control’s DOM tree. In this common case, the content may be either anything
supported by jQuery’s append() function: a string, a DOM element, a jQuery
object (including a control), an array, etc.
</p>
<p>
The standardization of the content function makes it easier to learn how to use
new control classes, simplifies the transfer of data into or out of various
controls, and minimizes the amount of code which must be rewritten when
experimenting to see which control class works best for a job. It also
facilitates the creation of meta-controls, discussed later.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> sets the content on instances of several different control
classes. Each class implements the content() function differently. *** One of
the controls is an instance of the Repeater control, a meta-control that creates
a given number of instances of the indicated control class. (Meta-controls are
covered later.) The Repeater class’ content() property is defined to set the 
same content on all the controls it has generated. ***
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that just because the same content property can be set on all these
controls doesn’t mean all controls can accept the same types of content. Some
controls can only accept text content, some only expect a single element, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Add instances of the TextBox and AutoSizeTextBox control
classes to the demo, and see how they handle their content.
