<title>Tutorial: Using QuickUI controls in your application</title>

    BasicButton.create().content( "Hello" ),
    BasicButton.create().content( "World" )

<b>Core idea:</b> The QuickUI framework lets you can build good user interfaces
quickly with reliable, reusable, and adaptable UI components called controls.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial is a sequence of short, live code exercises demonstrating how to
create a user interface using QuickUI controls. Each tutorial page proposes a
goal for you to try yourself.
</p>
<p>
This page (like the pages that follow) has already loaded a recent version of
the jQuery framework and the quickui.js file for the QuickUI framework. For
instructional purposes, this page has also loaded the .js and .css file for the
optional <Link href="/catalog">QuickUI Catalog</Link> of common controls.
</p>

<p>
<b>The demo code</b> on this particular page creates two instances of a QuickUI control
class called BasicButton. Each call to BasicButton’s create() method returns an
instance of that class: an independent, self-contained copy of all the elements
the control needs to function. Each instance is subsequently modified to set its
content (label) to a string value.
</p>
<p>
The two buttons are then handed to the jQuery append() function, which adds them
to a <span data-control="Tag">div</span> on this page. For demo purposes, that div has already been
created and made available to the JavaScript code through the identifier
“$demo”. In your own code, you would obtain a similar reference with any jQuery
selector.
</p>
<p>
You can see the result of the running code on the right. The buttons react to
mouse events and keyboard focus, but don't do anything else yet. They show
generic styling: the minimum styling necessary to use the control. Most
designers will want to style the controls further to fit their application’s
visual aesthetic; more on that later.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your goal:</b> Create a third button by adding another call to BasicButton.create()
to the invocation of jQuery’s append() function. Once you’ve updated the code,
press the Run button (or type Ctrl+Enter) to see the result.
