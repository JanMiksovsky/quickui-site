 * Optional QuickUI CSS file to support use of the rehydrate() feature.
 * This file is *not* required by the core quickui.js runtime. It can be
 * included in cases where an app is rehydrating static HTML pages, and wants
 * to avoid a flash of static content before that content is rehydrated. 
 */

/*
 * Until a control has been rehydrated, we try to render the control and any
 * subelements invisible by setting opacity to zero. This avoids a flash of
 * dehydrated content before the rehydrate plugin can reconstitute the controls.
 * Once the control has been rehydrated, the data-control attribute will
 * automatically be removed, which in turn will remove these style overrides.
 * 
 * The purpose of dehydrated controls is to ensure that their contents can
 * be made available as static HTML to web search engines, ideally to make
 * the page content searchable. Presumably search engines like Google are
 * highly skeptical of pages with content that's theoretically visible to
 * the web crawling robots but (at least initially) invisible to people.
 * Time will tell whether this approach to hiding dehydrated control content
 * hinders the SEO value of the page.
