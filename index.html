<h1>Create a great user interface with extensible web components</h1>

<p>
<button data-control="SampleSpriteButton" id="buttonTutorial">Interactive Tutorial</button>
</p>

<p>
<b>Users deserve great web apps</b> with clean, intuitive, responsive user
interfaces that fit the task and are a joy to use. But the basic web platform
itself makes building such interfaces hard. You, as a web designer or developer,
have to do so much work just to recreate interface elements that look the way
you want, respond the way users expect, and exploit the capabilities of the
user’s device or browser to their fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
QuickUI is a JavaScript framework that lets you create your web app with user
interface components called <i>controls</i>. A user interface control class
includes all DOM elements, interactive behavior, and visual styling necessary
for the control to function. You can define a control to implement any level of
your app's UI: a page template, a region on the page, a special button, etc.
With this approach, you can bring all the benefits of traditional object-
oriented design to bear on your JavaScript UI code:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Organize your UI code logically.</li>
<li>Start with well-tested UI building blocks.</li>
<li>Quickly iterate on the design of your app’s interface.</li>
<li>Share common UI solutions with your teammates and the web at large.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Controls are comparable to widgets in other UI frameworks — but a widget in such
frameworks is typically a monolithic block of functionality you can neither
disassemble, extend, or recombine. QuickUI controls are built for flexibility
from the ground up, so you can adapt any control to your needs.
</p>

<h2>What makes QuickUI different from other web frameworks?</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Composability</b>. This means you can generally put one control inside
another. When other frameworks offer, say, a date picker, it’s a solid,
immutable block; you can’t actually stick anything inside the date picker, so
your ability to customize the experience is limited to those customizations the
widget's author thought you'd want. Most QuickUI controls, in contrast, are
designed you can place one control inside another whenever that would make
sense.
</li>
<li>
<b>Modularity</b>. Good controls should only have local effects and
dependencies. When you add a control to a page, you don’t want to suddenly
discover that the control is inadvertently stomping on, say, CSS styles you’re
using elsewhere. Similarly, a control shouldn’t make lots of demands on its
container; you should be able to stick a control anywhere and get something
reasonable. In QuickUI, all controls are designed to be as context-independent
as possible. Moreover, the QuickUI framework ensures that your controls have
deterministic, reliable access to their own elements — your code won’t
accidentally pick up other elements on the page.
</li>
<li>
<b>Extensibility</b>. You can easily create specialized version of a control
class by subclassing it. This is a killer feature, because it lets you build new
components out of existing ones. QuickUI provides well-defined semantics for how
a subclass and its parent classes can work together to populate the DOM. Most
frameworks that let you create UI subclasses force you to wrap the elements of a
parent class, which turns out to be a dead end. In contrast, a QuickUI subclass
populates “slots” in its base class — and can define new slots of its own. For
more on this approach, see
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/rendering.html">how controls
render themselves</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Opacity</b>. You can quickly define an external-facing API for your control
class, obviating the need or temptation for other developers to muck about
inside your control’s DOM. This keeps your control’s contract with its host
container clean and well-defined, allowing you to evolve your controls without
breaking everyone who’s already using them.
</li>
<li>
<b>Helpers for common UI situations</b>. QuickUI’s runtime has helper functions
to address situations that often come up when creating reusable controls, such
as controls that need to perform custom layout calculations when they're added
to the DOM, or when their size changes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Control classes are first-class objects</b>. QuickUI permits the creation of
meta-controls that can take another control class as input. For example, you can
tell a <a data-control="CatalogLink">ListBox</a> control which control class
should be used to represent its individual list items, and the ListBox will
automatically take care of creating or destroying instances of that item class
as the set of list items changes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Search engine support</b>. You want the best of both worlds: to create UI in
JavaScript <i>and</i> have UI text content searchable by Google and other search
engines. QuickUI lets you reference controls in searchable HTML and then
<a data-control="Link" href="/tutorial/rehydration.html">rehydrate</a>
those controls in the user’s browser. If you inspect this page's
<span data-control="Tag">body</span> tag, for example, you'll see how the site's
page template (which is implemented as a QuickUI control) is applied on the
client to what's otherwise plain, searchable HTML.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>A good citizen of the open web</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Built on top of <a data-control="Link" href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>,
the web’s most popular JavaScript library.
</li>
<li>
Works in all mainstream browsers: Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft
Internet Explorer 8+, and Mozilla Firefox. QuickUI leverages the browser as much
as possible. It uses native browser features when possible and, in older
browsers, can serve as a polyfill for HTML5 features. QuickUI is planned to
coevolve with the emerging HTML specification for web components.
</li>
<li>
Agnostic with regards to your back end, your data binding model, your
workflow, and your tool pipeline.
</li>
<li>
Free and open. The <a data-control="Link" href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui">source code</a>
is open under the

</li>
</ul>

<h2>A catalog of parts to start with</h2>
<p>
The optional <a data-control="Link" href="/catalog/">QuickUI Catalog</a> is
library of ~80 UI controls. Each control tries to do just one thing really well,
and these are intended as starting point for your own UI. Originally designed
for full browsers, many controls work on mobile browsers as well.
</p>
<p>
The page you are reading now, and this entire site, is built using QuickUI and
controls from the QuickUI Catalog.

<li>

tutorial</a>.
