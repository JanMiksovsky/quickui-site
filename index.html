<h1>Create a great user interface with extensible web components</h1>

<p>
<b>Users deserve great web apps</b> with clean, intuitive, responsive user
interfaces that fit the task and are a joy to use. But the basic web platform
itself makes building such interfaces hard. You, as a web designer or developer,
have to do so much work just to recreate interface elements that look the way
you want, respond the way users expect, and exploit the capabilities of the
user’s device or browser to their fullest extent.
</p>

<p>
QuickUI is a JavaScript framework that lets you create your web app with user
interface components called <i>controls</i>. A user interface control class
includes all DOM elements, interactive behavior, and visual styling necessary
for the control to function. You can define a control to implement any level of
your app's UI: a page template, a region on the page, a special button, etc.
With this approach, you can bring all the benefits of traditional object-
oriented design to bear on your JavaScript UI code:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Organize your UI code logically.</li>
<li>Start with well-tested UI building blocks.</li>
<li>Quickly iterate on the design of your app’s interface.</li>
<li>Share common UI solutions with your teammates and the web at large.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Controls are comparable to widgets in other UI frameworks — but a widget in such
frameworks is typically a monolithic block of functionality you can neither
disassemble, extend, or recombine. QuickUI controls are built for flexibility
from the ground up, so you can adapt any control to your needs.
</p>

<h2>Remixable user interface components</h2>
<p>
    Every web user interface framework offers a date picker component, but
    QuickUI packs a world of power into the one it gives you. Here's the
    typical example:
</p>
<div>
    <div data-control="DateComboBox">
        <div data-property="dropdownButtonContent">
            <!-- Custom icon; see notes at /catalog/DateComboBox -->
            <img ref="calendarIcon" src="/catalog/resources/calendar_alt_fill_16x16.png"/>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    (Whenever you're up for it, you can check out the docs and source for the above
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">DateComboBox</a> component, or any of the other
    components described here.)
    There are actually a lot of pieces here that work together to make the
    date picker — and every one of those pieces of functionality is given
    to you as a component in its own right. The combo box behavior, for
    example:
</p>
<div><div data-control="ComboBox"></div></div>
<p>
    With that, you can make lots of other kinds of combo boxes, like a
    *** combo box for picking things from lists ***. In a date combo box,
    the text box portion needs to actually understand how to parse and
    represent dates, so that's offered as its own DateTextBox component:
</p>
<div><div data-control="DateTextBox"></div></div>
<p>
    And the popup portion of a date picker shows a calendar month that you
    can navigate through:
    *** CalendarMonthNavigator keyboard navigation ***
</p>
<div><div data-control="CalendarMonthNavigator"></div></div>
<p>
    The ability to navigate left and right between months is a general
    user interface pattern that crops up in lots of other situations — so
    of course that's delivered as a component as well:
</p>
<div><div data-control="SequenceNavigator"></div></div>
<p>
    In this case, you're navigate among months. The month itself is rendered
    using a component:
    *** CalendarMonthWithHeadings hides dates outside month by default,
    CalendarMonthNavigator turns them back on ***
</p>
<div><div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings"></div></div>
<p>
    And each piece of the month — the headings, the cells for the days, etc.,
    are all available as components, all of which you can use.
</p>
<p>
    Graph thumbnail and link to full graph. Better graph lines, legend.
</p>
<p>
    There are many reasons why building user interfaces this way makes a lot
    of sense. One is that reusable components permit heavier in investment
    in fundamentals. Take localizing a calendar to other languages. This turns
    out to be a complex task. It's not just a matter of changing the names
    for the months and days of the week, you also have to consider factors
    such as the order in which different prefer to write dates (day/month/year
    versus month/day/year or year/month/day, and so on) as well as the fact
    that different cultures prefer to see different days of the week as the
    "first" day of a week (Sunday in North American, Monday in Europe,
    Monday in Arabic cultures). Few teams can afford to invest that kind of
    effort — but if everyone shares an implementation, it's worth it: 
</p>
<div>
    <div data-control="Carousel" style="display: inline-block;">
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="fr"></div>
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="ja"></div>
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="th"></div>
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="ar"></div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    (Naturally, the ability to flip between those different calendars is
    a component too.)
</p>
<p>
    Of course, everyone's needs are different. That's why all QuickUI
    components are designed to be remixed: composed with other components,
    extended with custom behavior, and generally adapted to the needs of
    your app. In the case of this calendar, you can tell the calendar
    to use a different component to render the days — and in that component,
    you can do whatever you want. Maybe you want to show a weather forecast:
</p>
<!-- <div><div data-control="FlickrInterestingDay"></div></div> -->
<!-- <div><div data-control="FlickrInterestingNavigator"></div></div> -->
<p>
    Or maybe you want to create a *** calendar of the most interested
    photo of any given day ***.
</p>
<p>
    And if you have more complex needs, you can easily recombine these
    elements to create, for example, a date <i>range</i> picker that picks
    both a start and end date in a single component:
    *** CalendarMonthNavigator keyboard navigation ***
</p>
<!-- <div><div data-control="CalendarDateRangeSelector"></div></div> -->
<p>
    These days, your web applications need to be <i>responsive</i> and
    adapt to the capabilities of the device and OS the user is running.
    It's easy to create QuickUI components that go far beyond what's possible
    with responsive CSS, and create components that use fundamentally
    different presentations based on the context. The following date picker
    uses a mobile OS' native date picker on a mobile device, but the date
    combo box above on a full browser:
</p>
<!-- <div><div data-control="ResponsiveDatePicker"></div></div> -->

<h2>What makes QuickUI different from other web frameworks?</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Composability</b>. This means you can generally put one control inside
another. When other frameworks offer, say, a date picker, it’s a solid,
immutable block; you can’t actually stick anything inside the date picker, so
your ability to customize the experience is limited to those customizations the
widget's author thought you'd want. Most QuickUI controls, in contrast, are
designed you can place one control inside another whenever that would make
sense.
</li>
<li>
<b>Modularity</b>. Good controls should only have local effects and
dependencies. When you add a control to a page, you don’t want to suddenly
discover that the control is inadvertently stomping on, say, CSS styles you’re
using elsewhere. Similarly, a control shouldn’t make lots of demands on its
container; you should be able to stick a control anywhere and get something
reasonable. In QuickUI, all controls are designed to be as context-independent
as possible. Moreover, the QuickUI framework ensures that your controls have
deterministic, reliable access to their own elements — your code won’t
accidentally pick up other elements on the page.
</li>
<li>
<b>Extensibility</b>. You can easily create specialized version of a control
class by subclassing it. This is a killer feature, because it lets you build new
components out of existing ones. QuickUI provides well-defined semantics for how
a subclass and its parent classes can work together to populate the DOM. Most
frameworks that let you create UI subclasses force you to wrap the elements of a
parent class, which turns out to be a dead end. In contrast, a QuickUI subclass
populates “slots” in its base class — and can define new slots of its own. For
more on this approach, see
<a data-control="Link" href="/docs/rendering.html">how controls
render themselves</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Opacity</b>. You can quickly define an external-facing API for your control
class, obviating the need or temptation for other developers to muck about
inside your control’s DOM. This keeps your control’s contract with its host
container clean and well-defined, allowing you to evolve your controls without
breaking everyone who’s already using them.
</li>
<li>
<b>Helpers for common UI situations</b>. QuickUI’s runtime has helper functions
to address situations that often come up when creating reusable controls, such
as controls that need to perform custom layout calculations when they're added
to the DOM, or when their size changes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Control classes are first-class objects</b>. QuickUI permits the creation of
meta-controls that can take another control class as input. For example, you can
tell a <a data-control="CatalogLink">ListBox</a> control which control class
should be used to represent its individual list items, and the ListBox will
automatically take care of creating or destroying instances of that item class
as the set of list items changes.
</li>
<li>
<b>Search engine support</b>. You want the best of both worlds: to create UI in
JavaScript <i>and</i> have UI text content searchable by Google and other search
engines. QuickUI lets you reference controls in searchable HTML and then
<a data-control="Link" href="/tutorial/rehydration.html">rehydrate</a>
those controls in the user’s browser. If you inspect this page's
<span data-control="Tag">body</span> tag, for example, you'll see how the site's
page template (which is implemented as a QuickUI control) is applied on the
client to what's otherwise plain, searchable HTML.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>A good citizen of the open web</h2>

<ul>

<h2>A catalog of parts to start with</h2>
<p>
The optional <a data-control="Link" href="/catalog/">QuickUI Catalog</a> is
library of ~80 UI controls. Each control tries to do just one thing really well,
and these are intended as starting point for your own UI. Originally designed
for full browsers, many controls work on mobile browsers as well.
</p>
<p>
The page you are reading now, and this entire site, is built using QuickUI and
controls from the QuickUI Catalog.
