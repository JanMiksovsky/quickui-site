    <p>
    QuickUI is a free and open JavaScript framework that lets you create your
    web application's user interface with components called <i>controls</i>. A
    control includes all the DOM elements, interactive behavior, and visual
    styling necessary for the component to function. You can define a control to
    implement any level of your app's UI: a page template, a region on the page,
    a special button, etc. This approach lets you apply all the benefits of
    traditional object-oriented design to your JavaScript UI code. You'll have a
    rich set of components you can assemble into a great web application with a
    clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface.

    Every web framework offers a date picker, but a date picker built in QuickUI
    packs in a world of power. You can see a typical example on the right.
    (Whenever you're up for it, you can check out the docs and source for
    this <a data-control="CatalogLink">DateComboBox</a> control and the other
    controls described here.)
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="DateComboBox">
        <div data-property="dropdownButtonContent">
            <!-- Custom icon; see notes at /catalog/DateComboBox -->
            <img ref="calendarIcon" src="/catalog/resources/calendar_alt_fill_16x16.png"/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">A deceptively simple date picker…</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    It may not look like much, but under the covers, many pieces are working
    together to make this date picker function. Every one of those pieces
    is available to you as a useful component in its own right. Take the combo
    box behavior, for example, which joins a popup with a text box, and adds a
    little dropdown arrow for discoverability. You can use the 
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">ComboBox</a> class on its own (see right),
    or a common subclass called
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">ListComboBox</a> that specializes in presenting
    the user's choice in a list.
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="ComboBox">
        <div data-property="popup">
            [Some UI to select choices goes here]
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">… starts from a combo box base</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    In the date picker case, the text box portion of a date picker needs to
    actually understand how to parse and represent dates, so that's offered as
    its own <a data-control="CatalogLink">DateTextBox</a> control.
    The DateTextBox doesn't have a popup — it just handles dates as text.
    Generally speaking, QuickUI controls try to do just one thing really well.
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="DateTextBox"></div>
    <div class="caption">… and combines a date-aware text input control with …</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    The DateTextBox above gets combined with a
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">CalendarMonthNavigator</a> that
    just focuses on letting you navigate through dates, one month at a time.
    Try the calendar on the right. This sort of in-line calendar might be a
    much better choice for your application's user interface than a normal, tiny
    date picker. If you have the room for an inline-calendar, and selecting a
    date is an important part of your UI, then an in-line calendar lets the
    user select a date without having to go through the trouble of finding and
    opening a popup calendar.

<tr>
<td>
    The ability to navigate left and right (here, between months) is a general
    user interface pattern that crops up in lots of other situations — so
    of course that's delivered as a control as well. In this case, it's a
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">LateralNavigator</a>, which is also the basis
    of controls like <a data-control="CatalogLink">Carousel</a> (right) that
    can navigate through sets of things like images.
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="Carousel" style="display: inline-block;">
        <img data-control="FlickrInterestingPhoto" data-autoLoad="true" data-photoSize="s"/>
        <img data-control="FlickrInterestingPhoto" data-autoLoad="true" data-photoSize="s"/>

        <img data-control="FlickrInterestingPhoto" data-autoLoad="true" data-photoSize="s"/>
        <img data-control="FlickrInterestingPhoto" data-autoLoad="true" data-photoSize="s"/>
    </div>
    <div class="caption">Each aspect can be used in other ways, like the navigation…</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    Here, you're navigating among calendar months. The month itself is rendered
    using a static
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">CalendarMonthWithHeadings</a> control. This
    control doesn't deal with navigation at all — it can focus entirely on just
    rendering a clean, accurate calendar.
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings"></div>
    <div class="caption">… or the static month calendar</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    <p>
    Each piece of the month — the headings, the cells for the days, etc.,
    are all available as controls, all of which you can use. These components
    take care of all the date math, so you don't have to worry about that.
    </p>
    <p>
    In all, the little date picker control turns out to be constructed from
    twenty different control classes, each playing a clearly-defined role
    in the date picker's final appearance and behavior. You can see these
    class relationships represented visually below (click for a larger graph).
    You can use each of those contributing control classes on their own, or in
    new combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a data-control="Link" href="/catalog/DateComboBox" style="border: none;">
        <img data-control="ControlClassGraph" data-graphClass="DateComboBox" style="border: none; width: 580px;"/>
    </a>
    </p>
    <p>
    The point of this date picker example is not (just) that QuickUI has good
    date controls — the point is that the QuickUI framework gives you a
    powerful way to express your user interface in classes.

    <h2>Waaaay beyond styling</h2>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
    <p>
    Previous user interface frameworks only gave you big, chunky UI widgets to
    work with. Your ability to customize them is limited to the things the
    widget author could image you'd want to change. And while you can 
    customize thigns a bit, there's a limit to what's possible with CSS.
    QuickUI lets you go way beyond that limit, with controls that can
    accept <i>other</i> controls.
    </p>
    <p>
    Suppose you can have a product like, say,
    Flickr and want to show interesting the most
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/"">interesting photo
    of the day</a> on a calendar. Using the <a data-control="CatalogLink">CalendarDay</a>
    control as a starting point, create a new calendar-day-with-photo control.
    Drop that control into the <i>exact same</i> calendar month navigator
    control shown above, and voilà, a photo calendar:
    </p>
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="FlickrInterestingDay" data-autoLoad="true"></div>
    <div class="caption">A day control that shows a photo</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
    <div data-control="FlickrInterestingNavigator"></div>    
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    <p>
    Or you could create a new day control that renders a date with both Roman
    numerals and kanji calligraphy, and drop that into a calendar month for a
    result that's not possible with CSS alone:
    </p>
    <div data-control="KanjiCalendarMonth"></div>
</td>
<td>
    <div data-control="KanjiCalendarDay" style="display: inline-block;"></div>
    <div class="caption">A day control that includes calligraphy</div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<h2>Remixable user interface controls</h2>
    <p>
    Everyone's user interface needs are different. That's why all QuickUI
    controls are designed to be remixed: composed with other controls,
    extended with custom behavior, and generally adapted to the needs of
    your app. In the case of this calendar, you can tell the calendar
    to use a different control to render the days — and in that control,
    you can do whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>
    Or suppose you have more complex needs, and need to let the user select a
    date <i>range</i>. You can recombine the above elements to create a date
    range selector:
    </p>
    <div data-control="DateRangeCalendar" data-count="3"></div>
    <p>
    This particular example above makes use of a meta-control called
    <a data-control="CatalogLink">Repeater</a> that instantiates a given control
    class multiple times, so you can quickly adapt your UI to show two months,
    or four months, or however many work best.
    </p>

    <h2>Shared components encourage investment in fundamentals</h2>
    <p>
    There are many reasons why building user interfaces this way makes a lot of
    sense. One is that reusable components change the economics of making a
    heavier investment in user interface fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Take the complex chore of
    localizing a calendar to other languages. The QuickUI date controls use the
    <a href="https://github.com/jquery/globalize">Globalize</a> library, which
    supports roughly 350 different cultures around the world. Here are some
    instances of the same calendar month control, only now they've been
    instructed to show a calendar appropriate to French, Japanese, or Thai
    cultures:
    </p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
    <div class="inlineDemos">
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="fr"></div>
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="ja"></div>
        <div data-control="CalendarMonthWithHeadings" data-culture="th"></div>
    </div>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
    <p>
    Not only do the text labels for the month or days of the week change,
    different cultures prefer to see different days of the week as the "first"
    day of a week: Sunday in North American, Monday in Europe. And different
    cultures expect to see the different parts of a date rendered differently in
    text, so the DateTextBox control changes its presentation (and date parsing)
    accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Few teams can afford to invest that kind of effort — but if everyone shares
    an implementation, then that kind of investment will produce returns for
    everyone. Other examples of investments the component approach makes more
    reasonable are: performance, keyboard support, general accessibility, 
    cutting-edge CSS optimization, and device responsiveness.

    <h2>What makes QuickUI different from other web frameworks?</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Composability</b>. This means you can generally put one control inside
    another. When other frameworks offer, say, a date picker, it’s a solid,
    immutable block; you can’t actually stick anything inside the date picker, so
    your ability to customize the experience is limited to those customizations the
    widget's author thought you'd want. Most QuickUI controls, in contrast, are
    designed you can place one control inside another whenever that would make
    sense.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Modularity</b>. Good controls should only have local effects and
    dependencies. When you add a control to a page, you don’t want to suddenly
    discover that the control is inadvertently stomping on, say, CSS styles you’re
    using elsewhere. Similarly, a control shouldn’t make lots of demands on its
    container; you should be able to stick a control anywhere and get something
    reasonable. In QuickUI, all controls are designed to be as context-independent
    as possible. Moreover, the QuickUI framework ensures that your controls have
    deterministic, reliable access to their own elements — your code won’t
    accidentally pick up other elements on the page.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Extensibility</b>. You can easily create specialized version of a control
    class by subclassing it. This is a killer feature, because it lets you build new
    controls out of existing ones. QuickUI provides well-defined semantics for how
    a subclass and its parent classes can work together to populate the DOM. Most
    frameworks that let you create UI subclasses force you to wrap the elements of a
    parent class, which turns out to be a dead end. In contrast, a QuickUI subclass
    populates “slots” in its base class — and can define new slots of its own. For
    more on this approach, see
    <a data-control="Link" href="/docs/rendering.html">how controls
    render themselves</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Opacity</b>. You can quickly define an external-facing API for your control
    class, obviating the need or temptation for other developers to muck about
    inside your control’s DOM. This keeps your control’s contract with its host
    container clean and well-defined, allowing you to evolve your controls without
    breaking everyone who’s already using them.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Helpers for common UI situations</b>. QuickUI’s runtime has helper functions
    to address situations that often come up when creating reusable controls, such
    as controls that need to perform custom layout calculations when they're added
    to the DOM, or when their size changes.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Control classes are first-class objects</b>. QuickUI permits the creation of
    meta-controls that can take another control class as input. For example, you can
    tell a <a data-control="CatalogLink">ListBox</a> control which control class
    should be used to represent its individual list items, and the ListBox will
    automatically take care of creating or destroying instances of that item class
    as the set of list items changes.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Search engine support</b>. You want the best of both worlds: to create UI in
    JavaScript <i>and</i> have UI text content searchable by Google and other search
    engines. QuickUI lets you reference controls in searchable HTML and then
    <a data-control="Link" href="/tutorial/rehydration.html">rehydrate</a>
    those controls in the user’s browser. If you inspect this page's
    <span data-control="Tag">body</span> tag, for example, you'll see how the site's
    page template (which is implemented as a QuickUI control) is applied on the
    client to what's otherwise plain, searchable HTML.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Good citizen of the open web</h2>
<p>
QuickUI is built with <a data-control="Link" href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>,
the web’s most popular JavaScript library, and works in all mainstream
browsers: Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer 8+, and
Mozilla Firefox. The framework is agnostic with regards to your back end, your
data binding model, your workflow, and your tool pipeline.
</p>
<p>
QuickUI is free, and the
<a data-control="Link" href="https://github.com/JanMiksovsky/quickui">source code</a>
is open under the
<a data-control="Link" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.
</p>

<h2>A catalog of parts to start with</h2>
<p>
The optional <a data-control="Link" href="/catalog/">QuickUI Catalog</a> is a
library of approximately 80 UI controls. Each control tries to do just one thing
really well, and these are intended as starting point for your own UI.
Originally designed for full browsers, many of the catalog controls work on
mobile browsers as well. The page you are reading now, and this entire site, is
built using QuickUI and controls from the QuickUI Catalog.
